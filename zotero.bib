	abstract = {Evolutionary biology is widely perceived as a discipline with relevance that lies purely in academia. Until recently, that perception was largely true, except for the often neglected role of evolutionary biology in the improvement of agricultural crops and animals. In the past two decades, however, evolutionary biology has assumed a broad relevance extending far outside its original bounds. Phylogenetics, the study of Darwin's theory of “descent with modification,” is now the foundation of disease tracking and of the identification of species in medical, pharmacological, or conservation settings. It further underlies bioinformatics approaches to the analysis of genomes. Darwin's “evolution by natural selection” is being used in many contexts, from the design of biotechnology protocols to create new drugs and industrial enzymes, to the avoidance of resistant pests and microbes, to the development of new computer technologies. These examples present opportunities for education of the public and for nontraditional career paths in evolutionary biology. They also provide new research material for people trained in classical approaches.},

	abstract = {We developed a theoretical framework based on phylogenetic comparative methods to integrate phylogeny into three measures of biodiversity: species variability, richness, and evenness. These metrics can be used in conjunction with permutation procedures to test for phylogenetic community structure. As an illustration, we analyzed data on the composition of 58 lake fish communities in Wisconsin. The fish communities showed phylogenetic underdispersion, with communities more likely to contain closely related species. Using information about differences in environmental characteristics among lakes, we demonstrated that phylogenetic underdispersion in fish communities was associated with environmental factors. For example, lakes with low pH were more likely to contain species in the same clade of acid‐tolerant species. Our metrics differ from existing metrics used to calculate phylogenetic community structure, such as net relatedness index and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity. Our metrics have the advantage of providing an integrated and easy‐to‐understand package of phylogenetic measures of species variability, richness, and evenness with well‐defined statistical properties. Furthermore, they allow the easy evaluation of contributions of individual species to different aspects of the phylogenetic organization of communities. Therefore, these metrics should aid with the incorporation of phylogenetic information into strategies for understanding biodiversity and its conservation.},

	abstract = {Bacterial communities are composed of distinct groups of potentially interacting lineages, each thought to occupy a distinct ecological niche. It remains unclear, however, how quickly niche preference evolves and whether more closely related lineages are more likely to share ecological niches. We addressed these questions by following the dynamics of two bloom-forming cyanobacteria genera over an 8-year time-course in Lake Champlain, Canada, using 16S amplicon sequencing and measurements of several environmental parameters. The two genera, Microcystis (M) and Dolichospermum (D), are frequently observed simultaneously during bloom events and thus have partially overlapping niches. However, the extent of their niche overlap is debated, and it is also unclear to what extent niche partitioning occurs among strains within each genus. To identify strains within each genus, we applied minimum entropy decomposition (MED) to 16S rRNA gene sequences. We confirmed that at a genus level, M and D have different preferences for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Within each genus, we also identified strains differentially associated with temperature, precipitation, and concentrations of nutrients and toxins. In general, niche similarity between strains (as measured by co-occurrence over time) declined with genetic distance. This pattern is consistent with habitat filtering – in which closely-related taxa are ecologically similar, and therefore tend to co-occur under similar environmental conditions. In contrast with this general pattern, similarity in certain niche dimensions (notably particulate nitrogen and phosphorus) did not decline linearly with genetic distance, and instead showed a complex polynomial relationship. This observation suggests the importance of processes other than habitat filtering – such as competition between closely-related taxa, or convergent trait evolution in distantly-related taxa – in shaping particular traits in microbial communities.},

For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations and allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies including Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.},

To what extent such innovations have adaptive or non-adaptive origins is hard to assess in real organisms. This limitation, however, can be overcome using digital organisms, i.e. self-replicating computer programs that mutate, evolve and coevolve within a user-defined computational environment. Here, we quantify the role of the non-adaptive origins of host resistance traits in determining the evolution of ecological interactions among host and parasite digital organisms. We find that host resistance traits arising spontaneously as exaptations increase the complexity of antagonistic host–parasite networks. Specifically, they lead to higher host phenotypic diversification, a larger number of ecological interactions and higher heterogeneity in interaction strengths. Given the potential of network architecture to affect network dynamics, such exaptations may increase the persistence of entire communities. Our in silico approach, therefore, may complement current theoretical advances aimed at disentangling the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms shaping species interaction networks.

Summary

Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) is the tendency of lineages to retain their niche-related traits through speciation events. A recent surge in the availability of well-sampled molecular phylogenies has stimulated phylogenetic approaches to understanding ecological processes at large geographical scales and through macroevolutionary time. We stress that PNC is a pattern, not a process, and is found only in some traits and some lineages. At the simplest level, a pattern of PNC is an inevitable consequence of evolution – descent with modification and divergence of lineages – but several intrinsic causes, including physicochemical, developmental and genetic constraints, can lead directly to a marked pattern of PNC. A pattern of PNC can also be caused indirectly, as a by-product of other causes, such as extinction, dispersal limitation, competition and predation. Recognition of patterns of PNC can contribute to understanding macroevolutionary processes: for example, release from constraint in traits has been hypothesized to trigger adaptive radiations such as that of the angiosperms. Given the multiple causes of patterns of PNC, tests should address explicit questions about hypothesized processes. We conclude that PNC is a scientifically useful concept with applications to the practice of ecological research.},

	abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

	doi = {10.1111/ecog.02314},
	abstract = {The abundance–adaptation hypothesis argues that taxa with more individuals and faster generation times will have more evolutionary ‘experiments’ allowing expansion into, and diversification within, novel habitats. Thus, as older taxa have produced more individuals over time, and smaller taxa have higher population sizes and faster generation times, the Latitudinal Diversity Gradients (LDGs) of these clades should show shallower slopes. We describe the LDGs for archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and trees from six North American forests. For three focal groups – bacteria, ants, and trees – older taxa had shallower LDG slopes than the more recent, terminal taxa. Across 12 orders of magnitude of body mass, LDG slopes were steeper in larger taxa. The slopes of LDGs vary systematically with body size and clade age, underscoring the non-canonical nature of LDGs. The steepest LDG slopes were found for the largest organisms while the smallest, from bacteria to small litter-soil invertebrates, have shallower- to zero-slope LDGs. If tropical niche conservatism is the failure of clades to adapt to, and diversify in temperate habitats, then the steep LDGs of chordates and plants likely arise from the decreased ability of clades with large individuals to adapt to the multiple challenges of extra-tropical life. © 2017 The Authors},

Methods: We quantified the shape of the distribution ranges of 10,057 species of birds and 5,411 species of mammals, and assessed the relationship of range shape with latitude and range size using generalized additive models. The observed pattern was compared with that predicted by a null model, in which species ranges were constrained only by the shape of the landmasses. Furthermore, we divided each range in two polygons and measured their separate perimeters, to compare the limits of the poleward and equatorward portions of each range. Results: In terrestrial mammals and birds, only species living at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and with large range sizes have ranges that consistently tend to be elongated in an east–west direction. The difference between observed and null range shapes increases from the Southern Hemisphere and the tropics towards the north. The difference between equatorward and poleward semi-perimeters was relevant only in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is probably explained by the shape of the continents. Main conclusions: The existence of a latitudinal gradient in range shape is consistent with a different role of deterministic and stochastic processes in the tropics versus high latitudes. Specifically, the results are in line with a scenario in which tropical niche conservatism and relatively evolutionarily labile lower thermal tolerance increase the relevance of climate in determining range limits towards the poles, with stochastic factors (e.g., dispersal limitation) more relevant in shaping low-latitude range limits. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Historical biogeography has become narrowly focused on using phylogenies to discover the history of geological connections among regions. Conversely, ecologists often ignore historical biogeography, even when its input can be crucial. Both historical biogeographers and ecologists have more-or-less abandoned attempts to understand the processes that determine the large-scale distribution of clades. Here, we describe the chasm that has developed between ecology and historical biogeography, some of the important questions that have fallen into it and how it might be bridged. To illustrate the benefits of an integrated approach, we expand on a model that can help explain the latitudinal gradient of species richness.},

Another is a general desire, among almost all of the respondents, for greater understanding, more collaboration, and closer interactions between empirical and theoretical work. The final theme is that institutions, such as journals, funding agencies, and universities, are often seen as hindering such interactions.

To evaluate this hypothesis, I review the literature on selection experiments in heterogeneous environments. The niche width usually – but not invariably – evolves to match the amount of environmental variation, specialists evolving in homogeneous environments and generalists evolving in heterogeneous environments. The genetics of niche width are more complex than has previously been recognized, particularly with respect to the magnitude of costs of adaptation and the putative constraints on the evolution of generalists. Genetic variation in fitness is more readily maintained in heterogeneous environments than in homogeneous environments and this diversity is often stably maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection. Moreover environmental heterogeneity appears to be a plausible mechanism for at least two well-known patterns of species diversity at the landscape scale. I conclude that environmental heterogeneity is a plausible and possibly very general explanation for diversity across the range of scales from individuals to landscapes.},

Classically, we think of our microbiome as stable, benign, and cooperative. Recent experimental work is beginning to unpick essential functions that can be attributed to the stable microbiota of humans. To be able to manipulate the microbiome to improve health, we need to understand community structure and composition and we need models to quantify and predict stability. Coyte et al. applied concepts and tools from community ecology to gut microbiome assembly. Independently developed models converged on a surprising answer: A high diversity of species is likely to coexist stably when the system is dominated by competitive, rather than cooperative, interactions.
Science, this issue p. 663
The human gut harbors a large and complex community of beneficial microbes that remain stable over long periods. This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability—including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members—and support our key predictions with recent data.
Diversity and competition are more likely than cooperation to lead to gut microbial community stability.

We then explore a few of these runs in detail, discovering important properties of lexicase selection; these may in turn help us better understand the dynamics of lexicase selection, and the ways in which it differs from tournament selection. More broadly, we illustrate the value of recording and analyzing this level of detail, both as a means of understanding the dynamics of particular runs, and as a way of generating questions and ideas for subsequent, broader study.},

Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios.},

	abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

Abstract
Interactions among species drive the ecological and evolutionary processes in ecological communities. These interactions are effectively key components of biodiversity. Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the field the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would benefit from their study.},

Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

	abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide “slices” of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the conventional role of evolution in evolutionary computation (EC) as an optimization algorithm, a new class of evolutionary algorithms has emerged in recent years that instead aim to accumulate as diverse a collection of discoveries as possible, yet where each variant in the collection is as fit as it can be. Often applied in both neuroevolution and morphological evolution, these new quality diversity (QD) algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution's inherent strengths, thereby offering a promising niche for EC within the broader field of machine learning. However, because QD algorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive study has yet attempted to systematically elucidate their relative strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Taking a first step in this direction, this paper introduces a new benchmark domain designed specifically to compare and contrast QD algorithms. It then shows how the degree of alignment between the measure of quality and the behavior characterization (which is an essential component of all QD algorithms to date) impacts the ultimate performance of different such algorithms. The hope is that this initial study will help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify the disparate ideas in the area.},

Even low rates of sweeps can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral mutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region in the center of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population. The fact that nearly all ancestry rapidly traces back to a small spatial region also means that relatedness between individuals falls off very slowly as a function of the spatial distance between them.

A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify ‘anchor’ representatives: for α-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

	abstract = {1. The objectives of this paper are to test the performance of the taxonomic distinctness index, Δ+, in a number of environmental impact scenarios, to examine its relationship with functional diversity and to examine the influence of habitat type and diversity on the index. 2. The index was applied to data on free-living marine nematodes from the coasts of Britain and Chile. 3. The taxonomic distinctness of nematodes from environmentally degraded locations was generally reduced in comparison with that of more pristine locations, often significantly so. 4. Some habitat types may have naturally lower values of taxonomic distinctness than others. However, unless the habitats are degraded in some way the Δ+ values do not generally fall below the lower 95\% confidence limit of the simulated distribution under a null hypothesis that the assemblages behave as if they are a random selection from the regional species pool. This ameliorates the problem encountered with species richness measures of biodiversity, which are much more strongly affected by habitat type and complexity, thus making comparisons difficult between data sets from different habitats or where habitat type is uncontrolled. 5. Taxonomic distinctness in marine nematodes is shown to be related to trophic diversity: a reduction in trophic diversity will lead to a reduction in taxonomic distinctness, although not necessarily to a reduction in species richness. Trophic composition itself is clearly affected by pollution, but is also strongly responsive to the major influence of habitat type. 6. These features of the taxonomic distinctness index, coupled with its lack of dependence on sampling effort or differences in taxonomic rigour between workers and a statistical framework for the assessment of the significance of departure from expectation, suggest that it may prove to be a biologically and ecologically relevant measure of biodiversity. 7. This paper demonstrates that the taxonomic distinctness index has a number of theoretical and logistical advantages over measures of species richness for the purposes of environmental assessment.},

The second is the astounding success of fecal microbial transplantation in treating certain diseases related to disordered microbiomes. Surprisingly, both phenomena have not been analytically or quantitatively understood, despite a few early qualitative attempts. This work shows that through a dynamic systems and control theoretical approach the success of fecal microbial transplantation can be explained and that the microbiome-based stratification can be as simple as the existence of strongly interacting species.},

Our approach uses metagenomic DNA to construct large‐scale heterologous expression libraries that are tracked over time in vivo by deep sequencing and computational methods. To demonstrate our approach, we built a TFUMseq plasmid library using the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and introduced Escherichia coli carrying this library into germfree mice. Population dynamics of library clones revealed Bt genes conferring significant fitness advantages in E. coli over time, including carbohydrate utilization genes, with a Bt galactokinase central to early colonization, and subsequent dominance by a Bt glycoside hydrolase enabling sucrose metabolism coupled with co‐evolution of the plasmid library and E. coli genome driving increased galactose utilization.

It combines three simple basic functions to form a composite multimodal function, in which the function parameter controls the number of global minima. The resultant composite function may show a variety of challenges in global optimization such as high condition, correlation, and presence of many undesirable local minima, as well as those peculiar to multimodal optimization, such as non-uniformly distributed global minima with dissimilar basin sizes. Moreover, the proposed procedure results in computationally inexpensive composite functions, when compared to those generated by available methods. This allows for benchmarking long-term success of niching methods on problems with many global minima. Six parametric benchmark functions are proposed in which the function parameter controls the number of global minima. Detailed analysis on distribution, basin shapes and sizes of the global minima is provided. One of the proposed test problems involve constraints, a matter which did not receive much attention in the past. These test functions are employed to compare some of the most successful niching methods in the literature. The numerical results disclose a drastic disparity between the performance of different niching methods on the composite functions and the existing test problems, demonstrating that the proposed composite functions simulate distinct challenges.

	abstract = {abstract: Because of the correlation expected between the phylogenetic relatedness of two taxa and their net ecological similarity, a measure of the overall phylogenetic relatedness of a community of interacting organisms can be used to investigate the contemporary ecological processes that structure community composition. I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees (≥10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co‐occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

	abstract = {Conservation priority setting based on phylogenetic diversity has frequently been proposed but rarely implemented. Here, we define a simple index that measures the contribution made by different species to phylogenetic diversity and show how the index might contribute towards species-based conservation priorities. We describe procedures to control for missing species, incomplete phylogenetic resolution and uncertainty in node ages that make it possible to apply the method in poorly known clades. We also show that the index is independent of clade size in phylogenies of more than 100 species, indicating that scores from unrelated taxonomic groups are likely to be comparable. Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts, suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that are both evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (EDGE species) do not benefit from existing conservation projects or protected areas. The results suggest that global conservation priorities may have to be reassessed in order to prevent a disproportionately large amount of mammalian evolutionary history becoming extinct in the near future.},

These graphs highlight important moments in the evolutionary process. They also allow us to compare the dynamics for successful and unsuccessful runs. As well as displaying these full ancestry graphs, we use a variety of standard techniques such as size, color, pattern, labeling, and opacity to visualize other important information such as fitness, which genetic operators were used, and the distance between parent and child genomes.

Artificial Life has largely been concerned with evolutionary ecosystems of agents in trivial environments. Ecology commonly produces models of specific habitats and organism populations unsuited to general exploration of theoretical issues. We propose that limitations of the simulations in these disciplines can be overcome by simulating ecosystems from the level of artificial chemistry. We demonstrate the approach’s feasibility by describing several virtual organisms represented at this level. The organisms automatically adopt trophic levels, generate energy from chemical bonds and transform material elements in the process. Virtual organisms may interact with one another and their abiotic environment using the same chemistry. Biosynthesis and decay may also be simulated through this mechanism.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have shown great promise in evolving novel solutions to real-world problems, but the complexity of those solutions is still limited, unlike the apparently open-ended evolution that occurs in the natural world. The power of traditional evolutionary algorithms is constrained by rapid convergence to a single solution on a sub-optimal local peak, leading to stagnation. In part, nature surmounts these complexity barriers with ecological dynamics that generate a diverse array of raw materials for evolution to build upon.
In this dissertation I focus on one ecological force that increases diversity: frequency-dependent selection that arises from competition among individuals for finite resources. I explore the benefits of incorporating this force into an algorithmic framework, focusing on how this mechanism can increase diversity to provide many evolutionary paths to a problem solution. The use of niching to simultaneously approach a single solution from many directions has not been extensively studied in previous literature. I study competition for limited resources in a digital evolution system and examine the importance of specific resource parameters on population dynamics. I show that my techniques are robust at increasing diversity over a broad range of settings for each parameter, and that the parameter settings are governed by a relatively simple set of equations.
Finally I introduce Eco-EA, a general form of an evolutionary algorithm that associates a limited resource with each trait to be evolved. I apply Eco-EA to several problems, including a real-world software engineering problem, and I show that the Eco-EA yields several advantages over traditional evolutionary algorithm approaches, including: (1) significantly more rapid evolution of targeted complex functions; (2) discovery and maintenance of a diverse set of partial solutions that together solve a problem; (3) maintenance of a selection of high-quality final solutions for the researcher to choose from, often with slightly different properties; and (4) discovery of solutions that are more evolvable when placed in new environments.},

	abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer–resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

Using the same population sizes, fitness sharing shows a large improvement in the error rate for both problems. Further experiments compare the treatments on learning recursive list membership functions; again, there are dramatic improvements in error rate. Conversely, fitness sharing runs achieve comparable results to raw fitness using populations two to three times smaller.

Unlike most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase selection does not base selection on a fitness value that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it considers test cases one at a time in random order. We present results comparing lexicase selection to more traditional parent selection methods, including standard tournament selection and implicit fitness sharing, on four uncompromising problems: 1) finding terms in finite algebras; 2) designing digital multipliers; 3) counting words in files; and 4) performing symbolic regression of the factorial function. We provide evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher levels of population diversity than other selection methods, which may partially explain its utility as a parent selection algorithm in the context of uncompromising problems.},

Novel methods are making it possible to evaluate the relative importance of each of these drivers. However, the lack of appropriate methods has prevented evaluating the extent to which interaction networks are shaped by species’ evolutionary histories. This study includes the evolutionary histories of species among the potential drivers of interactions, allowing the comparative analysis of its importance in structuring ecological networks. We hypothesized different possible phylogenetic scenarios to predict frequencies of interactions between species by combining concepts from the fields of ecological networks and ecophylogenetics. The usage of these scenarios is illustrated in a plant-hummingbird interaction network database from the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. We first evaluated which phylogenetic hypotheses better predict the observed network; subsequently, we evaluated the relative importance of species evolutionary histories, abundances, and matching on species morphologies and phenologies as drivers of their frequencies of interactions. The results suggest that the evolutionary histories of hummingbirds are more important than the species abundances in structuring the studied plant–hummingbird network but less important than the morphological and phenological matching among species. The approach developed here offers the potential to advance our understanding of the multiple factors structuring ecological networks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

The analysis revealed the dynamics of five major classes of bacterial communities and showed that some communities change markedly over short time periods, whereas others are relatively stable. Modeling community stability using new quantitative measures indicates that deviation from stability correlates with time in the menstrual cycle, bacterial community composition, and sexual activity. The women studied are healthy; thus, it appears that neither variation in community composition per se nor higher levels of observed diversity (co-dominance) are necessarily indicative of dysbiosis.
The vaginal microbiome is dynamic, varying over time in composition and function with implications for women’s health.

	abstract = {The importance of the conservation of all three fundamental levels of biodiversity (ecosystems, species and genes) has been widely acknowledged, but only in recent years it has become technically feasible to consider intraspecific diversity, i.e. the genetic component to biodiversity. In order to facilitate the assessment of biodiversity, considerable efforts have been made towards identifying surrogates because the efficient evaluation of regional biodiversity would help in designating important areas for nature conservation at larger spatial scales. However, we know little about the fundamental relationships among the three levels of biodiversity, which impedes the formulation of a general, widely applicable concept of biodiversity conservation through surrogates. Here, we present the set-up of an international, interdisciplinary project, IntraBioDiv (http://www.intrabiodiv.eu), which studied vascular plant biodiversity at a large scale, i.e. across the European Alps and the Carpathians. Our assessment comprises species richness (high-mountain flora), genetic variation (amplified fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs) and environmental diversity (modelled potential habitat diversity). Our primary aims were to test for correlations between intra- and interspecific diversity and to identify possible environmental surrogates to describe biodiversity in the two study regions. To the best of our knowledge, IntraBioDiv represents the first multispecies study on intraspecific, molecular-genetic variation in relation with species and habitat diversity. Here, we outline the theoretical background, our sampling scheme, the technical approaches and the feasibility of a concentrated and standardized sampling effort. We further show exemplary results. Our three data sets will be made freely available and will provide a playground for further hypothesis testing in conservation, ecology or evolution open to the scientific community.},

Microbial communities can change abruptly in response to small perturbations, linked to changing conditions or the presence of multiple stable states. With sufficient samples or time points, such alternative states can be detected. In addition, temporal variation of microbial interactions can be captured with time-varying networks.

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

However, we do not yet know how these host-microbiome associations evolve. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for modelling the evolution of microbiomes. The models we use are neutral, and assume that microbes have no effect on the reproductive success of the hosts. Therefore, the patterns of microbiome diversity that we obtain in our simulations require a minimal set of assumptions relating to how microbes are acquired and how they are assembled in the environment. Despite the simplicity of our models, they help us understand the patterns seen in empirical data, and they allow us to build more complex hypotheses of host-microbe dynamics.},

Understanding how multiple competitors might coexist on a single resource has focused on the prescriptive formalism of a necessary niche width and limiting similarity. Here, we show how continuously varying life histories and trade-offs in these characteristics can allow multiple competitors to coexist, and we reveal how limiting similarity emerges and is shaped by the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of competitors. In this way, we illustrate how the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes acts to shape ecological communities in a unique way. This leads us to argue that evolutionary processes (life-history trait trade-offs) are fundamental to the understanding of the structure of ecological communities.
When competing predators have different life histories, they can coexist and survive utilizing a single limiting resource.

But because extent ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects, it is unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host–parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.

	abstract = {The uneven distribution of diversity is a conspicuous phenomenon across the tree of life. Ecological opportunity is a prominent catalyst of adaptive radiation and therefore may alter patterns of diversification. We evaluated the distribution of shifts in diversification rates across the cichlid phylogeny and the distribution of major clades across phylogenetic space. We also tested if ecological opportunity influenced these patterns. Colonization-associated ecological opportunity altered the tempo and mode of diversification during the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes. Clades that arose following colonization events diversified faster than other clades. Speciation rate shifts were non-randomly distributed across the phylogeny such that they were disproportionally concentrated around nodes that corresponded with colonization events (i.e., of continents, river basins, or lakes). Young clades tend to expand faster than older clades; however, colonization-associated ecological opportunity accentuated this pattern. There was an interaction between clade age and ecological opportunity that explained the trajectory of clades through phylogenetic space over time. Our results indicate that ecological opportunities afforded by continental- and ecosystem-scale colonization events explain the dramatic speciation rate heterogeneity and phylogenetic imbalance that arose during the evolutionary history of cichlid fishes.

Cane toads (Bufo marinus) are large anurans (weighing up to 2 kg) that were introduced to Australia 70 years ago to control insect pests in sugar-cane fields. But the result has been disastrous because the toads are toxic and highly invasive. Here we show that the annual rate of progress of the toad invasion front has increased about fivefold since the toads first arrived; we find that toads with longer legs can not only move faster and are the first to arrive in new areas, but also that those at the front have longer legs than toads in older (long-established) populations. The disaster looks set to turn into an ecological nightmare because of the negative effects invasive species can have on native ecosystems; over many generations, rates of invasion will be accelerated owing to rapid adaptive change in the invader, with continual ‘spatial selection’ at the expanding front favouring traits that increase the toads' dispersal.},

The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness.},

It is generally assumed that QS is used to coordinate cooperative behaviours at the population level. However, evolutionary theory predicts that individuals who communicate and cooperate can be exploited. Here we examine the social evolution of QS experimentally in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and show that although QS can provide a benefit at the group level, exploitative individuals can avoid the cost of producing the QS signal or of performing the cooperative behaviour that is coordinated by QS, and can therefore spread. We also show that a solution to the problem of exploitation is kin selection, if interacting bacterial cells tend to be close relatives. These results show that the problem of exploitation, which has been the focus of considerable attention in animal communication, also arises in bacteria.},

Although there is growing recognition of the significance of nontrophic interactions in ecology, these interactions are still poorly studied theoretically, and their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is largely unknown. Existing models of mutualism usually consider only one type of species interaction and do not satisfy mass balance constraints. Here, we present a model of an interaction web that includes both trophic and nontrophic interactions and that respects the principle of mass conservation. Nontrophic interactions are represented in the form of interaction modifications. We use this model to study the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties that emerges from the assembly of entire interaction webs. We show that ecosystem properties such as biomass and production depend not only on species diversity but also on species interactions, in particular on the connectance and magnitude of nontrophic interactions, and that the nature, prevalence, and strength of species interactions in turn depend on species diversity. Nontrophic interactions alter the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and biomass and can profoundly influence ecosystem processes.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.

	abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

Current methods of designing and optimizing antennas by hand are time and labor intensive, limit complexity, and require significant expertise and experience. Evolutionary design techniques can overcome these limitations by searching the design space and automatically finding effective solutions that would ordinarily not be found. The ST5 antenna was evolved to meet a challenging set of mission requirements, most notably the combination of wide beamwidth for a circularly-polarized wave and wide bandwidth. Two evolutionary algorithms were used: one used a genetic algorithm style representation that did not allow branching in the antenna arms; the second used a genetic programming style tree-structured representation that allowed branching in the antenna arms. The highest performance antennas from both algorithms were fabricated and tested, and both yielded very similar performance. Both antennas were comparable in performance to a hand-designed antenna produced by the antenna contractor for the mission, and so we consider them examples of human-competitive performance by evolutionary algorithms. As of this writing, one of our evolved antenna prototypes is undergoing flight qualification testing. If successful, the resulting antenna would represent the first evolved hardware in space, and the first deployed evolved antenna.},

We examined this issue using digital organisms—computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. These findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection.},

	abstract = {Complex adaptive systems (cas), including ecosystems, governments, biological cells, and markets, are characterized by intricate hierarchical arrangements of boundaries and signals. In ecosystems, for example, niches act as semi-permeable boundaries, and smells and visual patterns serve as signals; governments have departmental hierarchies with memoranda acting as signals; and so it is with other cas. Despite a wealth of data and descriptions concerning different cas, there remain many unanswered questions about "steering" these systems. In Signals and Boundaries, John Holland argues that understanding the origin of the intricate signal/border hierarchies of these systems is the key to answering such questions. He develops an overarching framework for comparing and steering cas through the mechanisms that generate their signal/boundary hierarchies.Holland lays out a path for developing the framework that emphasizes agents, niches, theory, and mathematical models. He discusses, among other topics, theory construction; signal-processing agents; networks as representations of signal/boundary interaction; adaptation; recombination and reproduction; the use of tagged urn models (adapted from elementary probability theory) to represent boundary hierarchies; finitely generated systems as a way to tie the models examined into a single framework; the framework itself, illustrated by a simple finitely generated version of the development of a multi-celled organism; and Markov processes.},

	doi = {10.1101/148973},
	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is believed to be an evolutionary driver of biodiversity. Variability in the distribution of resource patches can allow an environment to support a wider variety of phenotypes for selection to act upon at the ecosystem level, which may lead to more species. However, the generality of this principle has not been thoroughly tested, as the relevant adaptive dynamics occur on evolutionary timescales. We overcame this challenge by performing experiments on populations of digital organisms in the Avida Digital Evolution Platform, in which we investigated the impact of spatial resource heterogeneity on phenotypic diversity. Since an important benefit of diversity may be increased evolutionary potential, we also tracked the probability of a complex trait evolving in the context of various levels of spatial heterogeneity. We found that spatial entropy and phenotypic diversity have a strong positive correlation and this relationship is consistent across various spatial configurations. Diversity also increases evolutionary potential, but has a much smaller impact than other components of environmental composition. The most important of these components was the mean number of resources present in locations across the environment, likely owing to the importance of building blocks for the evolution of complex features. These results suggest that a general relationship exists between spatial heterogeneity and diversity, beyond the specific ecosystems and timescales in which it has previously been studied. By examining this relationship in the context of phenotypic evolution, we advance a mechanistic understanding of the resulting dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that the likelihood of evolving various traits can be impacted by the spatial configuration of patches in which these traits are advantageous. These findings have implications for both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, as generating and maintaining diversity is critical to all forms of evolution.},

	abstract = {Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns of species ranges. In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species. In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow. Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow. Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions, with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching. Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

Analyzing mutants at and behind the propagating front, we found that evolution is not always led by the most resistant mutants; highly resistant mutants may be trapped behind more sensitive lineages.

We show that the evolution of alleles increasing the mutation or phenotypic switching rates toward cooperation is in itself a social dilemma. Although cooperative offspring are often unlikely to reproduce, due to high cost of cooperation, they can be seen both as a living public good and a part of the extended parental phenotype. The competition between individuals that generate cooperators and ones that do not is often more relevant than the competition between cooperators and non-cooperators. The dilemma of second-order cooperation we describe relates directly to eusociality, but can be also interpreted as a division of labor or a soma-germline distinction. The results of our simulations shine a new light on what Darwin had already termed a “special difficulty” of evolutionary theory and describe a novel type of cooperation dynamics.

	abstract = {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium state from the local natural environment by the importation of vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases because the same “urban-adaptable” species become increasingly widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban core are “global homogenizers”, found in cities worldwide. However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban adapters typically consist of early successional plants and “edge” animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration of local indigenous species.},

It is also possible that since linearly separable problems are often  used to test Genetic Algorithms, that Island Models may simply be particularly well suited to  exploiting the separable nature of the test problems. We explore this possibility by using the  infinite population models of simple genetic algorithms to study how Island Models can track  multiple search trajectories.

However, continuous exploration greatly increases search time. To reduce the cost of continuous exploration we combine one of these methods (the age-layered population structure (ALPS) algorithm [8, 9]) with an early stopping (ES) method [2] that greatly accelerates the time needed to evaluate a candidate solution during search. We show that this combined method outperforms an equivalent algorithm with neither ALPS nor ES, as well as regimes in which only one of these methods is used, on an evolutionary robotics task.},

Most of the published approaches to stimulate exploration rely on a distance between genotypes or phenotypes; however, such distances are difficult to compute when evolving neural networks due to (1) the algorithmic complexity of graph similarity measures, (2) the competing conventions problem and (3) the complexity of most neural-network encodings. In this paper, we introduce and compare two conceptually simple, yet efficient methods to improve exploration and avoid premature convergence when evolving both the topology and the parameters of neural networks. The two proposed methods, respectively called behavioral novelty and behavioral diversity, are built on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and on a user-defined distance between behaviors. They can be employed with any genotype. We benchmarked them on the evolution of a neural network to compute a Boolean function with a deceptive fitness. The results obtained with the two proposed methods are statistically similar to those of NEAT and substantially better than those of the control experiment and of a phenotype-based diversity mechanism.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator–prey interaction [Abrams, P. \& Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.},

Our model captures the main elements of both theories by incorporating the combined effects of area, isolation, stochastic colonization and extinction processes, habitat heterogeneity, and niche partitioning in a unified, demographically based framework. While classical niche theory predicts a positive relationship between species richness and habitat heterogeneity, our unified model demonstrates that area limitation and dispersal limitation (the main elements of island biogeography) may create unimodal and even negative relationships between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. We attribute this finding to the fact that increasing heterogeneity increases the potential number of species that may exist in a given area (as predicted by niche theory) but simultaneously reduces the amount of suitable area available for each species and, thus, increases the likelihood of stochastic extinction. Area limitation, dispersal limitation, and low reproduction rates intensify the latter effect by increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction. These analytical results demonstrate that the integration of island biogeography and niche theory provides new insights about the mechanisms that regulate the diversity of ecological communities and generates unexpected predictions that could not be attained from any single theory.},

Here, the use of spatial population structure in combination with local elitist replacement is shown to reduce bloat without a subsequent loss of performance. Theoretical concepts regarding inbreeding and the role of elitism are used to support the described approach. The proposed system behavior is confirmed via extensive computer simulations on benchmark problems.

Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological networks can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism phenotypes. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of logical computations (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed behaviors that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within evolutionary ecology (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).},

	abstract = {Real landscapes contain complex spatial patterns in the distribution of resources that vary over time; quantifying these patterns and their dynamics is the purview of landscape pattern analysis. Landscape pattern analysis involves quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of point patterns, linear networks, continuous surface patterns, and categorical patch mosaics, and sometimes custom hybridizations of these basic models, although the focus in landscape ecology and of this article has been on patch mosaics. In this context, landscape metrics are algorithms that quantify specific spatial characteristics of patches, classes of patches, or entire landscape mosaics, or of the patch mosaic in the neighborhood of each focal cell. These metrics fall into two categories: those that quantify the composition of the map without reference to spatial attributes (i.e., the variety and abundance of patch types), and those that quantify the spatial configuration of the map (i.e., the spatial character and arrangement, position, or orientation of patches within the class or landscape). Metrics are further categorized as structural metrics that measure physical structure of the mosaic without explicit reference to a particular phenomenon, or functional metrics that require additional parameterization and measure the structure of the mosaic as it relates to a specific organism or ecological process. Not surprisingly, landscape metrics are highly sensitive to landscape definition with respect to the thematic content and resolution, spatial grain and extent, and the landscape boundary. The current use and interpretation of landscape metrics is constrained by the lack of a proper theoretical understanding of metric behavior across a wide range of landscape structure gradients, the lack of a proper spatial and/or temporal reference framework for ecologically interpreting the computed value of each metric, and the challenges of choosing a parsimonious suite of metrics for a particular application given the plethora of existing metrics. Ultimately, the definition of the landscape, the establishment of a meaningful reference framework, and the choice of metrics should be based on some hypothesis about the observed landscape pattern and what processes or constraints might be responsible for that pattern. Fortunately, programs like FRAGSTATS make the calculation of landscape metrics practical and accessible to all landscape ecologists.},

	abstract = {Darwinian evolution favours genotypes with high replication rates, a process called 'survival of the fittest'. However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate {\textgreater}1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

Earlier theoretical work, however, has been limited to particularly simple types of spatial structure (linear environmental gradients and spatially discrete metapopulations), leaving unaddressed the effects of more realistic patterns of landscape heterogeneity, such as nonlinear gradients and spatially continuous patchiness. To elucidate the consequences of such complex landscapes, we adapt an established spatially explicit individual-based model of evolutionary branching. We show that branching is most probable at intermediate levels of various types of heterogeneity and that different types of heterogeneity have, to some extent, additive effects in promoting branching. In contrast to such additivity, we find a novel refugium effect in which refugia in hostile environments provide opportunities for colonization, thus increasing the probability of branching in patchy landscapes. Effects of patchiness depend on the scale of patches relative to dispersal. Providing a needed connection to empirical research on biodiversity and conservation policy, we introduce empirically accessible spatial environmental metrics that quantitatively predict a landscape’s branching propensity.},

This paper investigates this question analytically using two approaches. First, the analysis assumes that there is a certain fixed amount of computational resources available, and identifies the conditions under which it is advantageous to use multiple small runs. The second approach does not constrain the total cost and examines whether multiple properly-sized independent runs can reach the optimal solution faster than a single run. Although this paper is limited to additively-separable functions, it may be applicable to the larger class of nearly decomposable functions of interest to many GA users. The results suggest that, in most cases under the constant cost constraint, a single run with the largest population possible reaches a better solution than multiple independent runs. Similarly, a single large run reaches the global faster than multiple small runs. The findings are validated with experiments on functions of varying difficulty.},

	abstract = {For more than 50 y ecologists have believed that spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions promotes species richness by increasing opportunities for niche partitioning. However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area–heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity–diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area–heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings. The area–heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique perspective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation.},

According to this framework, pathogens that pose the greatest risk of breaking down resistance genes have a mixed reproduction system, a high potential for genotype flow, large effective population sizes, and high mutation rates. The lowest risk pathogens are those with strict asexual reproduction, low potential for gene flow, small effective population sizes, and low mutation rates.

As climates warm and precipitation patterns shift in the future, understanding the distribution of the diversity of plant drought tolerance is central to predicting future ecosystem function and resilience to climate change. These questions are especially pressing for the world’s 11,000 grass species, which dominate a large fraction of the terrestrial biosphere, yet are poorly characterized with respect to responses to drought. Here, we show that physiological drought tolerance, which varied tenfold among 426 grass species, is well distributed both climatically and phylogenetically, suggesting most native grasslands are likely to contain a high diversity of drought tolerance. Consequently, local species may help maintain ecosystem functioning in response to changing drought regimes without requiring long-distance migrations of grass species. Furthermore, physiologically drought-tolerant species had higher rates of water and carbon dioxide exchange than intolerant species, indicating that severe droughts may generate legacies for ecosystem functioning. In all, our findings suggest that diverse grasslands throughout the globe have the potential to be resilient to drought in the face of climate change through the local expansion of drought-tolerant species.},

Analysis of the coefficients of variation revealed that the abundance of understory plants was more heterogeneous in disturbed stands compared with reference stands. However, when nutrient availability differences were accounted for by detrending the plant cover data, understory variability within stands declined, and no differences between disturbed and reference stands could be distinguished. This finding suggests that nutrient availability has important effects on plant heterogeneity, which depend on past land use. Species dispersal, seed size, and phenology also explained variability in the spatial heterogeneity of plants, but generally only before soil nutrient differences were statistically controlled. In addition to demonstrating that past land use has long-term effects on plant heterogeneity, these results indicate that soil nutrients may play different roles in determining vegetation patterns in historically altered and unaltered forests.},

The habitat templet approach depends on defining templet axes appropriate to the organism(s) of interest, predicting the traits of species associated with different parts of the templet, and testing these predictions in a range of habitats whose positions in the templet have been determined. 2. In this study of thirty-five benthic insect taxa at fifty-four tributary sites of the Taieri River on the South Island of New Zealand, we chose as the temporal axis the intensity/frequency of disturbance, defined in terms of bed movement during high discharge events. As the spatial axis, we postulated that three features would provide refugia and therefore ameliorate disturbance—percentage of the bed with low shear stress, percentage of the bed made up of large substratum particles and availability of interstitial space in the bed—from which we derived a combined multivariate refugium axis. 3. More disturbed communities contained a significantly higher percentage of individuals possessing the following traits: small size, high adult mobility, habitat generalist (each predicted to confer resilience in response to disturbance), clinger, streamlined/flattened and with two or more life stages outside the stream (each predicted to confer resistance in the face of disturbance). When analyses were performed on the percentage of taxa having particular traits, the predicted positive relationships with average bed movement were found for high adult mobility and habitat generalist traits. 4. The percentage of variance in trait scores explained by intensity of disturbance was generally higher in sites with less refugia available and lower in sites further from the headwaters. The percentage of variance explained was higher in sites recently subject to a major high discharge disturbance, suggesting that disturbances tend to strengthen the pattern of preponderance of resilience/resistance traits. 5. We mapped insect taxa onto the two-dimensional templet, following Grime et al.’s triangular terrestrial plant classification. The full variety of resistance and resilience traits were represented in insect species throughout the templet, but taxa associated with more disturbed conditions generally displayed a larger number of resilience and resistance traits, combined, than taxa associated with more stable stream beds.},

	abstract = {Adaptive evolution, to a large extent, is a complex combinatorial optimization process. In this article we take beginning steps towards developing a general theory of adaptive “walks” via fitter variants in such optimization processes. We introduce the basic idea of a space of entities, each a 1-mutant neighbor of many other entities in the space, and the idea of a fitness ascribed to each entity. Adaptive walks proceed from an initial entity, via fitter neighbors, to locally or globally optimal entities that are fitter than their neighbors. We develop a general theory for the number of local optima, lengths of adaptive walks, and the number of alternative local optima accessible from any given initial entity, for the baseline case of an uncorrelated fitness landscape. Most fitness landscapes are correlated, however. Therefore we develop parts of a universal theory of adaptation on correlated landscapes by adaptive processes that have sufficient numbers of mutations per individual to “jump beyond” the correlation lengths in the underlying landscape. In addition, we explore the statistical character of adaptive walks in two independent complex combinatorial optimization problems, that of evolving a specific cell type in model genetic networks, and that of finding good solutions to the traveling salesman problem. Surprisingly, both show similar statistical features, encouraging the hope that a general theory for adaptive walks on correlated and uncorrelated landscapes can be found. In the final section we explore two limits to the efficacy of selection. The first is new, and surprising: for a wide class of systems, as the complexity of the entities under selection increases, the local optima that are attainable fall progressively closer to the mean properties of the underlying space of entities. This may imply that complex biological systems, such as genetic regulatory systems, are “close” to the mean properties of the ensemble of genomic regulatory systems explored by evolution. The second limit shows that with increasing complexity and a fixed mutation rate, selection often becomes unable to pull an adapting population to those local optima to which connected adaptive walks via fitter variants exist. These beginning steps in theory development are applied to maturation of the immune response, and to the problem of radiation and stasis. Despite the limitations of the adaptive landscape metaphor, we believe that further development along the lines begun here will prove useful.},

	abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

Such competition also can promote rapid phenotypic evolution and ecological divergence. This process may end with the stable occupation of distinct niches or, alternatively, may entail repeated bouts of evolution. Here we examine two Escherichia coli lineages, called L and S, that coexisted for more than 30,000 generations after diverging from a common ancestor. Both lineages underwent sustained phenotypic evolution based on global transcription and resource utilization profiles, with L seeming to encroach over time on the catabolic profile of S. Reciprocal invasion experiments with L and S clones from the same or different generations revealed evolutionary changes in their interaction, including an asymmetry that confirmed the encroachment by L on the niche of the S lineage. In general, L and S clones from the same generation showed negative frequency-dependent effects, consistent with stable coexistence. However, L clones could invade S clones from both earlier and later generations, whereas S clones could invade only L clones from earlier generations. In this system, the long-term coexistence of competing lineages evidently depended on successive rounds of evolution, rather than on initial divergence followed by a static equilibrium.},

These environmental changes can, in turn, affect the further evolution of that organism and any coexisting organisms. We examine these effects and feedbacks following evolution of a novel function in the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli. A characteristic feature of E. coli is its inability to consume citrate aerobically. However, that ability evolved in one of the LTEE populations. In this population, citrate-utilizing bacteria (Cit+) coexisted stably with another clade of bacteria that lacked the capacity to utilize citrate (Cit−). This coexistence was shaped by the evolution of a cross-feeding relationship in which Cit+ cells released the dicarboxylic acids succinate, fumarate, and malate into the medium, and Cit− cells evolved improved growth on these carbon sources, as did the Cit+ cells. Thus, the evolution of citrate consumption led to a flask-based ecosystem that went from a single limiting resource, glucose, to one with five resources either shared or partitioned between two coexisting clades. Our findings show how evolutionary novelties can change environmental conditions, thereby facilitating diversity and altering both the structure of an ecosystem and the evolutionary trajectories of coexisting organisms.},

Nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether an evolving population's mean fitness can increase indefinitely, and potentially without any limit, even in a constant environment. A recent study showed that fitness trajectories of Escherichia coli populations over 50 000 generations were better described by a power-law model than by a hyperbolic model. According to the power-law model, the rate of fitness gain declines over time but fitness has no upper limit, whereas the hyperbolic model implies a hard limit. Here, we examine whether the previously estimated power-law model predicts the fitness trajectory for an additional 10 000 generations. To that end, we conducted more than 1100 new competitive fitness assays. Consistent with the previous study, the power-law model fits the new data better than the hyperbolic model. We also analysed the variability in fitness among populations, finding subtle, but significant, heterogeneity in mean fitness. Some, but not all, of this variation reflects differences in mutation rate that evolved over time. Taken together, our results imply that both adaptation and divergence can continue indefinitely—or at least for a long time—even in a constant environment.},

This innovation led to the frequency-dependent coexistence of citrate-consuming (Cit+) and non-consuming (Cit?) ecotypes, with Cit?bacteria persisting on the exogenously supplied glucose as well as other carbon molecules released by the Cit+ bacteria. After more than 10,000 generations of coexistence, however, the Cit?lineage went extinct; cells with the Cit?phenotype dropped to levels below detection, and the Cit?clade could not be detected by molecular assays based on its unique genotype. We hypothesized that this extinction was a deterministic outcome of evolutionary change within the population, specifically the appearance of a more-fit Cit+ ecotype that competitively excluded the Cit?ecotype. We tested this hypothesis by re-evolving the population from a frozen population sample taken within 500 generations of the extinction and from another sample taken several thousand generations earlier, in each case for 500 generations and with 20-fold replication. To our surprise, the Cit?type did not go extinct in any of these replays, and Cit?cells also persisted in a single replicate that was propagated for 2,500 generations. Even more unexpectedly, we showed that the Cit?ecotype could reinvade the Cit+ population after its extinction. Taken together, these results indicate that the extinction of the Cit?ecotype was not a deterministic outcome driven by competitive exclusion by the Cit+ ecotype. The extinction also cannot be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, as the population size of the Cit?ecotype should have been many thousands of cells even during the daily transfer events. Instead, we infer that the extinction must have been caused by a rare chance event in which some aspect of the experimental conditions was inadvertently perturbed.},

The two types, designated L and S, differ conspicuously in the size of the colonies they form on agar plates as well as the size of their individual cells, and these differences are heritable. The S type reached a detectable frequency ({\textbackslash}textgreater1\%) at generation 6,000, and it remained above that frequency throughout the subsequent generations. In addition to morphological differences, L and S diverged in important ecological properties. With clones isolated at 18,000 generations, L has a maximal growth rate in fresh medium that is ∼20\% higher than that of S. However, experiments with conditioned media demonstrate that L and S secrete one or more metabolites that promote the growth of S but not of L. The death rate of L during stationary phase also increases when S is abundant, which suggests that S may either secrete a metabolite that is toxic to L or remove some factor that enables the survival of L. One‐day competition experiments with the clones isolated at generation 18,000 show that their relative fitness is frequency dependent, with each type having an advantage when rare. When these two types are grown together for a period of several weeks, they converge on an equilibrium frequency that is consistent with the 1‐d competition experiments. Over the entire 14,000‐generation period of coexistence, however, the frequency of the S type fluctuated between approximately 10\% and 85\%. We offer several hypotheses that may explain the fluctuations in this balanced polymorphism, including the possibility of coevolution between the two types.},

	abstract = {The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for {\textbackslash}textgreater30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that “replayed” evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 × 1012 ancestral cells, nor among 9 × 1012 cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

Understanding how mutation rates themselves evolve is thus essential for quantitatively understanding many evolutionary processes. According to theory, mutation rates should be minimized for well-adapted populations living in stable environments, whereas hypermutators may evolve if conditions change. However, the long-term fate of hypermutators is unknown. Using a phylogenomic approach, we found that an adapting Escherichia coli population that first evolved a mutT hypermutator phenotype was later invaded by two independent lineages with mutY mutations that reduced genome-wide mutation rates. Applying neutral theory to synonymous substitutions, we dated the emergence of these mutations and inferred that the mutT mutation increased the point-mutation rate by ∼150-fold, whereas the mutY mutations reduced the rate by ∼40–60\%, with a corresponding decrease in the genetic load. Thus, the long-term fate of the hypermutators was governed by the selective advantage arising from a reduced mutation rate as the potential for further adaptation declined.},

We analyzed bacteria from whole-population samples frozen every 500 generations through 20,000 generations for one well-studied population, called Ara−1. By tracking 42 known mutations in these samples, we reconstructed the history of this population’s genotypic evolution over this period. The evolutionary dynamics of Ara−1 show strong evidence of selective sweeps as well as clonal interference between competing lineages bearing different beneficial mutations. In some cases, sets of several mutations approached fixation simultaneously, often conveying no information about their order of origination; we present several possible explanations for the existence of these mutational cohorts. Against a backdrop of rapid selective sweeps both earlier and later, two genetically diverged clades coexisted for {\textbackslash}textgreater6000 generations before one went extinct. In that time, many additional mutations arose in the clade that eventually prevailed. We show that the clades evolved a frequency-dependent interaction, which prevented the immediate competitive exclusion of either clade, but which collapsed as beneficial mutations accumulated in the clade that prevailed. Clonal interference and frequency dependence can occur even in the simplest microbial populations. Furthermore, frequency dependence may generate dynamics that extend the period of coexistence that would otherwise be sustained by clonal interference alone.},

In addition, we are concerned with the pattern of adaptation itself, particularly whether the rate of increase in mean fitness tends to decline with the number of generations of selection in a constant environment. The correspondence between the rate of increase in mean fitness and the within-population genetic variance of fitness, as expected from Fisher's fundamental theorem, is also addressed. Twelve Escherichia coli populations were founded from a single clonal ancestor and allowed to evolve for 2,000 generations. Mean fitness increased by about 37\%. However, the rate of increase in mean fitness was slower in later generations. There was no statistically significant within-population genetic variance of fitness, but there was significant between-population variance. Although the estimated genetic variation in fitness within populations was not statistically significant, it was consistent in magnitude with theoretical expectations. Similarly, the variance of mean fitness between populations was consistent with a model that incorporated stochastic variation in the timing and order of substitutions at a finite number of nonepistatic loci, coupled with substitutional delays and interference between substitutions arising from clonality. These results, taken as a whole, are consistent with theoretical expectations that do not invoke divergence due to multiple fitness peaks in a Wrightian evolutionary landscape.},

However, the conservation of evolutionary process is now also acknowledged as a priority in the face of global change. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a biodiversity index that measures the length of evolutionary pathways that connect a given set of taxa. PD therefore identifies sets of taxa that maximize the accumulation of 'feature diversity'. Recent studies, however, concluded that taxon richness is a good surrogate for PD. Here we show taxon richness to be decoupled from PD, using a biome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the flora of an undisputed biodiversity hotspot—the Cape of South Africa. We demonstrate that this decoupling has real-world importance for conservation planning. Finally, using a database of medicinal and economic plant use, we demonstrate that PD protection is the best strategy for preserving feature diversity in the Cape. We should be able to use PD to identify those key regions that maximize future options, both for the continuing evolution of life on Earth and for the benefit of society.},

	abstract = {Summary
The interspecies exchange of metabolites plays a key role in the spatiotemporal dynamics of microbial communities. This raises the question of whether ecosystem-level behavior of structured communities can be predicted using genome-scale metabolic models for multiple organisms. We developed a modeling framework that integrates dynamic flux balance analysis with diffusion on a lattice and applied it to engineered communities. First, we predicted and experimentally confirmed the species ratio to which a two-species mutualistic consortium converges and the equilibrium composition of a newly engineered three-member community. We next identified a specific spatial arrangement of colonies, which gives rise to what we term the “eclipse dilemma”: does a competitor placed between a colony and its cross-feeding partner benefit or hurt growth of the original colony? Our experimentally validated finding that the net outcome is beneficial highlights the complex nature of metabolic interactions in microbial communities while at the same time demonstrating their predictability.

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

	abstract = {Author summary Stable bacterial cross-feeding interactions, where one strain feeds on the waste of the other, are important to understand, as they can be a first step toward bacterial speciation. Their emergence is commonly observed in laboratory experiments using Escherichia coli as a model organism. Yet it is not clear how cross-feeding interactions can resist the invasion of a fitter mutant when the environment contains a single resource since there seems to be a single ecological niche. Here, we used another kind of “model organism”, a digital one, allowing for detailed and fast investigations, and providing a way to disentangle generic evolutionary mechanisms from specificities associated with E. coli. Digital organisms with evolvable genomes and metabolic networks compete for resources in conditions mimicking laboratory evolution experiments. In chemostat simulations, although cross-feeding interactions regularly emerged, selective sweeps regularly purged the population of its diversity. By contrast, batch culture allowed for much more stable cross-feeding interactions, because it includes seasons and thus distinct temporal niches, thereby favoring the adaptive diversification of proto-species.},

Because many species inhabit heterogeneous environments and have pronounced local adaptations, gene flow between differently adapted populations may be a persistent source of genetic variation within populations. If this migration-selection balance is biologically important then there should be strong correlations between genetic variance within populations and the amount of heterogeneity in the environment surrounding them. Here, we use data from a long-term study of 142 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) to compare levels of genetic variation in growth response with measures of climatic heterogeneity in the surrounding region. We find that regional heterogeneity explains at least 20\% of the variation in genetic variance, suggesting that gene flow and heterogeneous selection may play an important role in maintaining the high levels of genetic variation found within natural populations.},

	abstract = {Modern landscape ecology is based on the patch mosaic paradigm, in which landscapes are conceptualized and analyzed as mosaics of discrete patches. While this model has been widely successful, there are many situations where it is more meaningful to model landscape structure based on continuous rather than discrete spatial heterogeneity. The growing field of surface metrology offers a variety of surface metrics for quantifying landscape gradients, yet these metrics are largely unknown and/or unused by landscape ecologists. In this paper, we describe a suite of surface metrics with potential for landscape ecological application. We assessed the redundancy among metrics and sought to find groups of similarly behaved metrics by examining metric performance across 264 sample landscapes in western Turkey. For comparative purposes and to evaluate the robustness of the observed patterns, we examined 16 different patch mosaic models and 18 different landscape gradient models of landscape structure. Surface metrics were highly redundant, but less so than patch metrics, and consistently aggregated into four cohesive clusters of similarly behaved metrics representing surface roughness, shape of the surface height distribution, and angular and radial surface texture. While the surface roughness metrics have strong analogs among the patch metrics, the other surface components are largely unique to landscape gradients. We contend that the surface properties we identified are nearly universal and have potential to offer new insights into landscape pattern–process relationships.},

Today, as we experience rapid global urbanization, pressures on the natural environment to accommodate our daily needs for food, work, shelter, and recreation are greatly intensified. Concerted efforts to balance human use with ecological concerns are needed now more than ever.  A rich body of literature on the effect of human actions on the natural environment provides a window into what we now refer to as ecological design and planning. The study and practice of ecological design and planning provide a promising way to manage change in the landscape so that human actions are more in tune with natural processes. In The Ecological Design and Planning Reader Professor Ndubisi offers refreshing insights into key themes that shape the theory and practice of ecological design and planning. He has assembled, synthesized, and framed selected seminal published scholarly works in the field from the past one hundred and fifty years——ranging from Ebenezer Howard’s Garden Cities of To-morrow to Anne Whiston Spirn’s, “Ecological Urbanism: A Framework for the Design of Resilient Cities.” The reader ends with a hopeful look forward, which suggests an agenda for future research and analysis in ecological design and planning.  This is the first volume to bring together classic and contemporary writings on the history, evolution, theory, methods, and exemplary practice of ecological design and planning. The collection provides students, scholars, researchers, and practitioners with a solid foundation for understanding the relationship between human systems and our natural environment.},

	abstract = {Adaptive radiation refers to diversification from an ancestral species that produces descendants adapted to use a great variety of distinct ecological niches. In this review, I examine two aspects of adaptive radiation: first, that it results from ecological opportunity and, second, that it is deterministic in terms of its outcome and evolutionary trajectory. Ecological opportunity is usually a prerequisite for adaptive radiation, although in some cases, radiation can occur in the absence of preexisting opportunity. Nonetheless, many clades fail to radiate although seemingly in the presence of ecological opportunity; until methods are developed to identify and quantify ecological opportunity, the concept will have little predictive utility in understanding a priori when a clade might be expected to radiate. Although predicted by theory, replicated adaptive radiations occur only rarely, usually in closely related and poorly dispersing taxa found in the same region on islands or in lakes. Contingencies of a variety of types may usually preclude close similarity in the outcome of evolutionary diversification in other situations. Whether radiations usually unfold in the same general sequence is unclear because of the unreliability of methods requiring phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral events. The synthesis of ecological, phylogenetic, experimental, and genomic advances promises to make the coming years a golden age for the study of adaptive radiation; natural history data, however, will always be crucial to understanding the forces shaping adaptation and evolutionary diversification.},

However, Anolis also exhibits substantial species richness and ecomorphological disparity on mainland Central and South America. We compared patterns and rates of morphological evolution to investigate whether, in fact, island Anolis are exceptionally diverse relative to their mainland counterparts. Quite the contrary, we found that rates and extent of diversification were comparable—Anolis adaptive radiation is not an island phenomenon. However, mainland and Caribbean anoles occupy different parts of morphological space; in independent colonizations of both island and mainland habitats, island anoles have evolved shorter limbs and better-developed toe pads. These patterns suggest that the two areas are on different evolutionary trajectories. The ecological causes of these differences are unknown, but may relate to differences in predation or competition among mainland and island communities.},

Ecological theories, the most influential being the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, explain the species–area relationship as the outcome of the effect of area on immigration and extinction rates. However, these theories do not apply to taxa on land masses, including continents and large islands, that generate most of their species in situ. In this case, species–area relationships should be driven by higher speciation rates in larger areas, a theory that has never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the evolutionary theory. Within-island speciation exceeds immigration as a source of new species on all islands larger than 3,000 km2, whereas speciation is rare on smaller islands. Above this threshold island size, the rate of species proliferation increases with island area, a process that results principally from the positive effects of area on speciation rate. Also as expected, the slope of the species–area relationship jumps sharply above the threshold. Although Anolis lizards have been present on large Caribbean islands for over 30 million years, there are indications that the current number of species still falls below the speciation–extinction equilibrium.},

Unsurprisingly, total CEA increases with family and with species diversity and observed values are the same as expected from random sampling of family lists. However, when random sampling is done from species lists, observed CEAs are generally lower than expected. In vegetation types which have undergone recent diversification—grassland, fynbos and Nama-karoo—co-occurring species are more closely related than expected, but in subtropical thicket the observed CEAs are well described by random sampling. The use of CEA has great potential for assessing the age of biotic assemblages, particularly as the dating of genus and species-level phylogenies become more accurate.},

With its extremely high levels of endemism and species turnover, fynbos is made up of dissimilar local communities that are species-rich but relatively poor in rare species. Using neutral ecological theory, we show that the relative species-abundance distributions in fynbos can be explained by migration rates that are two orders of magnitude lower than they are in tropical rain forests. Speciation rates, which are indexed by the “biodiversity parameter” Θ, are estimated to be higher than they are in any previously examined plant system.
South African shrublands maintain diversity in many distinct regions featuring low migration and high speciation, in contrast to Amazon rain forests where the ranges of diverse species overlap widely.

In each round every individual “plays the game” with its immediate neighbours. After this, each site is occupied by its original owner or by one of the neighbours, depending on who scored the highest payoff. These rules specify a deterministic cellular automaton. We find that spatial effects can change the outcome of frequency dependent selection. Strategies may coexist that would not coexist in homogeneous populations. Spatial games have interesting mathematical properties. There are static or chaotically changing patterns. For symmetrical starting conditions we find “dynamical fractals” and “evolutionary kaleidoscopes.” There is a new world to be explored.},

Using the open-ended digital evolution software Avida, we evaluated the relative importance of these two factors in influencing evolutionary trajectories in the face of sudden environmental change. We examined how historical exposure to predation pressures, different levels of genetic variation, and combinations of the two, affected the evolvability of anti-predator strategies and competitive abilities in the presence or absence of threats from new, invasive predator populations. We show that while standing genetic variation plays some role in determining evolutionary responses, evolutionary history has the greater influence on a population's capacity to evolve anti-predator traits, i.e. traits effective against novel predators. This adaptability likely reflects the relative ease of repurposing existing, relevant genes and traits, and the broader potential value of the generation and maintenance of adaptively flexible traits in evolving populations.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biodiversity has become an important line of research in theoretical ecology and, in particular, conservation biology. However, studying the evolution of ecological communities under traditional modeling approaches based on differential calculus requires species' characteristics to be predefined, which limits the generality of the results. An alternative but less standardized methodology relies on intensive computer simulation of evolving communities made of simple, explicitly described individuals. We study here the formation, evolution, and diversity dynamics of a community of virtual plants with a novel individual-centered model involving three different scales: the genetic, the developmental, and the physiological scales. It constitutes an original attempt at combining development, evolution, and population dynamics (based on multi-agent interactions) into one comprehensive, yet simple model. In this world, we observe that our simulated plants evolve increasingly elaborate canopies, which are capable of intercepting ever greater amounts of light. Generated morphologies vary from the simplest one-branch structure of promoter plants to a complex arborization of several hundred thousand branches in highly evolved variants. On the population scale, the heterogeneous spatial structuration of the plant community at each generation depends solely on the evolution of its component plants. Using this virtual data, the morphologies and the dynamics of diversity production were analyzed by various statistical methods, based on genotypic and phenotypic distance metrics. The results demonstrate that diversity can spontaneously emerge in a community of mutually interacting individuals under the influence of specific environmental conditions.},

In the absence of mutations, that is, in a purely ecological setting, the abundances of the two types of organisms display a wide range of different types of oscillations, from regular oscillations with large amplitude to irregular oscillations with amplitudes ranging from small to large. In this regime, time-averaged abundance levels seem to be controlled by the relative fitness of the organisms in the absence of resources. Under mutational pressure, on the other hand, populations evolve that seem to avoid the oscillations of intermediate to large amplitudes. In this case, the relative fitness of the organisms in the presence of resources plays an important role in the time-averaged abundance levels as well.},

Here, we provide evidence for a previously undemonstrated dynamic that we call "strategy chases," wherein populations explore strategies with similar levels of complexity, but differing behaviorally. Indeed, in populations of evolving digital organisms, as prey evolved more effective predator-avoidance strategies, they explored a wider range of behavioral strategies in addition to exhibiting increased levels of behavioral complexity. Furthermore, coevolved prey became more adept in foraging, evidently through coopting components of explored sense-and-flee avoidance strategies into sense-and-retrieve foraging strategies. Specifically, we demonstrate that coevolution induced non-escalating exploration of behavioral space, corresponding with significant evolutionary advancements, including increasingly intelligent behavioral strategies.},

Remarkably, they find that the Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei), long debated as a threatened taxon, in fact represents the southern terminus of a relatively uniform lineage that expanded well into Alaska during the Holocene. By contrast, some other relictual and phylogenetically divergent taxa of jumping mice likely warrant greater conservation priority. This study highlights the value of integrative approaches that place current taxonomy in a broader evolutionary context to identify taxa for conservation assessment, but also highlights the challenges in maintaining potential for adaptive responses to environmental change.},

It is based on the detection of endogenous variations of the pattern using local density and second-order local neighbour density functions that allow delineation of irregularly shaped subplots that could be considered as internally homogeneous. Spatial statistics, such as Ripley's K-function adapted to analyse plots of irregular shape, can then be computed for each of the homogeneous subplots. Two applications to forest ecological field data demonstrate that the method, addressed to ecologists, can avoid misinterpretations of the spatial structure of heterogeneous vegetation stands.},

The new field was termed phylogeography. Since the naming of the field, the statistical rigor of phylogeography has increased, in large part due to concurrent advances in coalescent theory which enabled model-based parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The next phase will involve phylogeography increasingly becoming the integrative and comparative multi-taxon endeavor that it was originally conceived to be. This exciting convergence will likely involve combining spatially-explicit multiple taxon coalescent models, genomic studies of natural selection, ecological niche modeling, studies of ecological speciation, community assembly and functional trait evolution. This ambitious synthesis will allow us to determine the causal links between geography, climate change, ecological interactions and the evolution and composition of taxa across whole communities and assemblages. Although such integration presents analytical and computational challenges that will only be intensified by the growth of genomic data in non-model taxa, the rapid development of “likelihood-free” approximate Bayesian methods should permit parameter estimation and hypotheses testing using complex evolutionary demographic models and genomic phylogeographic data. We first review the conceptual beginnings of phylogeography and its accomplishments and then illustrate how it evolved into a statistically rigorous enterprise with the concurrent rise of coalescent theory. Subsequently, we discuss ways in which model-based phylogeography can interface with various subfields to become one of the most integrative fields in all of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

This approach focuses on current patterns of organismal and ecosystem-level biodiversity, but typically ignores the evolutionary processes that control the gain and loss of biodiversity at these and other levels (e.g., genetic, ecological). In order to include evolutionary processes in conservation planning efforts, their spatial components must first be identified and mapped. We describe a GIS-based approach for explicitly mapping patterns of genetic divergence and diversity for multiple species (a “multi-species genetic landscape”). Using this approach, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA datasets from 21 vertebrate and invertebrate species in southern California to identify areas with common phylogeographic breaks and high intrapopulation diversity. The result is an evolutionary framework for southern California within which patterns of genetic diversity can be analyzed in the context of historical processes, future evolutionary potential and current reserve design. Our multi-species genetic landscapes pinpoint six hotspots where interpopulation genetic divergence is consistently high, five evolutionary hotspots within which genetic connectivity is high, and three hotspots where intrapopulation genetic diversity is high. These 14 hotspots can be grouped into eight geographic areas, of which five largely are unprotected at this time.

	abstract = {We present an individual-based, spatial implementation of an existing two-locus population genetic model of niche construction. Our analysis reveals that, across a broad range of conditions, niche-construction traits can drive themselves to fixation by simultaneously generating selection that favours ‘recipient’ trait alleles and linkage disequilibrium between niche-construction and recipient trait alleles. The effect of spatiality is key, since it is the local, resource-mediated interaction between recipient and niche-constructing loci which gives rise to gene linkage. Spatial clustering effects point to a possible mechanism by which an initially rare recipient trait whose selection depends on niche construction could establish in an otherwise hostile environment. The same mechanism could also lead to the spread of an established niche-constructing colony. Similar phenomena are observed in the spatial modelling of two species ‘engineering webs’. Here, the activities of two niche-constructing species can combine to drive a particular recipient trait to fixation, or in certain circumstances, maintain the presence of polymorphisms through the preservation of otherwise deleterious alleles. This may have some relevance to ecosystem stability and the maintenance of genetic variation, where the frequencies of key resources are affected by the niche-constructing activities of more than one species. Our model suggests that the stability of multi-species webs in natural populations may increase as the complexity of species–environment interactions increases.},

One way to assist in achieving these goals is to integrate beneficial plant microbiomes—i.e., those enhancing plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance, and disease resistance—into agricultural production. This integration will require a large-scale effort among academic researchers, industry researchers, and farmers to understand and manage plant-microbiome interactions in the context of modern agricultural systems. Here, we identify priorities for research in this area: (1) develop model host–microbiome systems for crop plants and non-crop plants with associated microbial culture collections and reference genomes, (2) define core microbiomes and metagenomes in these model systems, (3) elucidate the rules of synthetic, functionally programmable microbiome assembly, (4) determine functional mechanisms of plant-microbiome interactions, and (5) characterize and refine plant genotype-by-environment-by-microbiome-by-management interactions. Meeting these goals should accelerate our ability to design and implement effective agricultural microbiome manipulations and management strategies, which, in turn, will pay dividends for both the consumers and producers of the world food supply.},

	abstract = {Current theory suggests that many signaling systems evolved from preexisting cues. In aposematic systems, prey warning signals benefit both predator and prey. When the signal is highly beneficial, a third species often evolves to mimic the toxic species, exploiting the signaling system for its own protection. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of predator cue utilization and prey signaling in a digital predator-prey system in which prey could evolve to alter their appearance to mimic poison-free or poisonous prey. In predators, we observed rapid evolution of cue recognition (i.e. active behavioral responses) when presented with sufficiently poisonous prey. In addition, active signaling (i.e. mimicry) evolved in prey under all conditions that led to cue utilization. Thus we show that despite imperfect and dishonest signaling, given a high cost of consuming poisonous prey, complex systems of interspecific communication can evolve via predator cue recognition and prey signal manipulation. This provides evidence supporting hypotheses that cues may serve as stepping-stones in the evolution of more advanced communication and signaling systems that incorporate information about the environment.},

	abstract = {Foraging strategies in uncertain environments is the subject of a great deal of biological investigation, much of which is grounded in mathematical models. One theoretical prediction with wide empirical support is the ideal free distribution (IFD), where agents distribute themselves among patches of resources in proportion to their suitability. However, the IFD assumes that agents have perfect information of the environment. In nature, this assumption is often violated, yet the IFD is still observed. Insights into evolved mechanisms and behaviors that result in the IFD show how such efficient outcomes may emerge from little information. In this study, the artificial life platform Avida is used to observe populations of digital organisms as they evolved to optimize resource intake in an environment with unpredictable resource distributions. It is shown that the ideal free distribution can emerge from simple foraging strategies that require minimal information. It is demonstrated that this distribution is a result of choices made by the organisms, and not simply due to those in a more advantageous setting producing more offspring. Deviations from the IFD appear to be correlated with reduced information or foraging aggregation. Distributions with organisms of differing abilities are also investigated, demonstrating further correspondence with theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, evolutionary computation (EC) has grown substantially in use for biologists and engineers alike. Its transparency makes it an indispensable tool for studying evolutionary- and ecological dynamics, and it has provided researchers with new insights that would be tremendously difficult, if not impossible, to gain using natural systems. In addition, EC has proven to be a powerful search algorithm for engineering applications, and has produced numerous novel and human-competitive solutions to complex problems. Although several well-established packages are readily available, it seems that when most users harness the power of evolutionary computation, they do so using "home-grown" solutions. This can likely be attributed to the ease with which simple models are created, the user's need for customization, and the sizeable learning barrier imposed by available solutions, as well as difficulties in extending them. We present SEEDS, a modular, open-source platform for conducting evolutionary computation experiments. SEEDS provides a simple, flexible, and extensible foundation that enables users with minimal programming experience to perform complex evolutionary and ecological simulations without having to first implement core functionality. In addition, SEEDS provides the tools necessary to make sharing data and reproducing experiments both easy and convenient.},

Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystem research. Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising features of natural ecosystems. These properties include populations of evolving agents, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions which generate local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial systems is then considered. An example architecture, the digital business ecosystem (DBE), is considered in detail. Simulation results imply that the DBE performs better at large scales than a comparable service-oriented architecture. These results suggest that incorporating ideas from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful self-organising properties in digital ecosystems.},

Less attention has been devoted to secondary extinctions resulting from ecological crises and the effect of community structure on such extinctions. Here we use a trophic network model that combines topological and dynamic approaches to simulate disruptions of primary productivity in palaeocommunities. We apply the model to Permian and Triassic communities of the Karoo Basin, South Africa, and show that while Permian communities bear no evidence of being especially susceptible to extinction, Early Triassic communities appear to have been inherently less stable. Much of the instability results from the faster post-extinction diversification of amphibian guilds relative to amniotes. The resulting communities differed fundamentally in structure from their Permian predecessors. Additionally, our results imply that changing community structures over time may explain long-term trends like declining rates of Phanerozoic background extinction},

We evolved communities of digital organisms, subjecting them to instantaneous “pulse” extinctions, choosing survivors at random, or to prolonged “press” extinctions involving a period of low resource availability. Functional activity at low trophic levels recovered faster than at higher levels, with the most extensive delays seen at the top level. Postpress communities generally did not fully recover functional activity in the allotted time, which equaled that of their original diversification. We measured recovery of phenotypic diversity, observing considerable variation in outcomes. Communities subjected to pulse extinctions recovered functional activity and phenotypic diversity substantially faster than when subjected to press extinctions. Follow‐up experiments tested whether organisms with shorter generation times and low functional activity contributed to delayed recovery after press extinctions. The results indicate that adaptation during the press episode degraded the organisms’ ability to reevolve preextinction functionality. There are interesting parallels with patterns from the paleontological record. We suggest that some delayed recoveries from mass extinction may reflect the need to both reevolve biological functions and reconstruct ecological interactions lost during the extinction. Adaptation to conditions during an extended disturbance may hinder subsequent recovery.},

We measured age of the phylogenetic root and tree stemminess, and evaluated how branching history of the phylogenetic trees was affected by the extinction treatments. We found that strong random (pulse) and strong selective extinction (press) both left clear long-term signatures in root age distribution and tree stemminess, and eroded deep branching history to a greater degree than did weak extinction and control treatments. The widely-used Pybus-Harvey gamma statistic showed a clear short-term response to extinction and recovery, but differences between treatments diminished over time and did not show a long-term signature. The characteristics of post-extinction phylogenies were often affected as much by the recovery interval as by the extinction episode itself.},

We focused our analysis on cases where the pre-extinction EQU clade had surviving descendents at the end of the extinction episode. To see if these clades retained the capacity to re-evolve EQU, we seeded one set of multiple subreplicate ‘replay’ populations using the most abundant survivor of the pre-extinction EQU clade, and another set with the actual end-extinction ancestor of the organism in which EQU re-evolved following the extinction episode.

	abstract = {The understanding of the mechanisms that promote biodiversity has implications for conservation and extinction of species and has raised the interest of the scientific community in the last decades. It is well established that spatial heterogeneity is an important factor influencing species richness. In this work we use a discrete computer simulation model to survey the impact of spatial heterogeneity on biodiversity patterns of an ecosystem in which species compete for limiting resources. The main feature of the model relies on the assumption that species have different requirements for a given resource. Individuals are arranged over a square lattice, where the sites are occupied by at most one individual. Individuals die at a fixed rate. Empty sites may be recolonized by newborn individuals according to a growth rate which depends on the ability of the individuals in the use of resources. We investigate the species–area relationship (SAR), the species abundance distribution and the dependence of species richness on the number of limiting resources and the degree of spatial heterogeneity. Commonly, the changes in the number of species with area is well approximated by a power law. Here, we show that the SAR displays two power law regimes. By assuming that the species’ abilities to consume resources are uneven, we found that the relationship between species richness and the degree of habitat heterogeneity is described by a unimodal function, being in agreement with experimental data. The dependence of the number of species with the number of resources was also investigated. Remarkably, it is the observation of an optimum value for the number of resources that maximizes the biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The topological properties of a network directly impact the flow of information through a system. In evolving populations, the topology of inter-individual interactions affects the rate of dissemination of advantageous genetic information and thus affects selective pressure. In this study, we investigate the selective pressures induced by several scale-free population structures using takeover time analysis. Previous results have shown that the selective pressures induced by scale-free interaction topologies are at least as strong as those induced by random and panmictic interaction topologies. In contrast, our results show that the selective pressures induced by scale-free interaction topologies are heavily influenced by their underlying topological properties, and can be tuned from a selective pressure close to that of a random or panmictic topology to a selective pressure that is weaker than that of a two-dimensional toroidal lattice with 3x3 rectangular neighborhoods of interactions. We also provide a detailed topological analysis of these population structures and discuss their influence on the observed dynamics in takeover times. We show that the expected takeover times observed on all population structures considered herein can be rapidly estimated using only a few readily computable metrics of the underlying topology, precluding the need to run expensive simulations or recursive probabilistic formulations.},

	abstract = {Directional selection is a major force driving adaptation and evolutionary change. However, the distribution, strength, and tempo of phenotypic selection acting on quantitative traits in natural populations remain unclear across different study systems. We reviewed the literature (1984–1997) that reported the strength of directional selection as indexed by standardized linear selection gradients (β). We asked how strong are viability and sexual selection, and whether strength of selection is correlated with the time scale over which it was measured. Estimates of the magnitude of directional selection ({\textbar}β{\textbar}) were exponentially distributed, with few estimates greater than 0.50 and most estimates less than 0.15. Sexual selection (measured by mating success) appeared stronger than viability selection (measured by survival). Viability selection that was measured over short periods (days) was typically stronger than selection measured over longer periods (months and years), but the strength of sexual selection did not vary with duration of selection episodes; as a result, sexual selection was stronger than viability selection over longer time scales (months and years), but not over short time scales (days).},

	abstract = {How strong is phenotypic selection on quantitative traits in the wild? We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients {\textbar}β{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients {\textbar}γ{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

We focus on the problem of identifying the stage in the game where successfully persuading an agent to perform a particular action will have the most impact on one's chances to win. Our approach exploits empirical data from game simulations, where the set up allows us to investigate individual aspects of the policy in suitably controlled ways. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach within the domain of The Settlers of Catan and present some specific lessons that can be learned for this particular game, e.g. that a tipping point in the game occurs for persuasion moves that are made when the leading player reaches 7 Victory Points.},

Much recent attention has focused on the analysis of complex population structures, characterized by heterogeneous connectivity distributions, non-trivial clustering properties, and degree–degree correlations. Here, we synthesize the results of these recent studies, discuss their limitations, and highlight several open questions regarding (1) unsolved theoretical issues and (2) the practical utility of complex population structures for evolutionary search. In addition, we will discuss an alternative complex population structure that is known to significantly influence dynamical processes, but has yet to be explored for evolutionary optimization. We then shift our attention toward dynamic population structures, which have received markedly less attention than their static counterparts. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of extant techniques and present open theoretical and experimental questions and directions for future research. In particular, we will focus on the prospects of “active linking,” wherein edges are dynamically rewired according to the genotypic or phenotypic properties of individuals, or according to the success of prior inter-individual interactions.},

In this review, we argue that, despite inherent challenges associated with reconstructing historical processes, the interplay of ecology and evolution is central to our understanding of macroevolution and community coexistence, and cannot be safely ignored in community and comparative phylogenetic studies. We highlight new research avenues that foster greater consideration of both ecological and evolutionary dynamics as processes that occur along branches of phylogenetic trees. By promoting new ways forward using this perspective, we hope to inspire further integration that creatively co-utilizes phylogenies and ecological data to study eco-evolutionary dynamics over time and space., Ecology and evolution interact over deep time scales, and innovative new research from a variety of fields is expanding our ability to understand these interactions and their effects., New developments in comparative phylogenetic methods incorporate species interactions in models of character change and lineage diversification, enabling direct tests of hypotheses concerning the impacts of ecological interactions on macroevolution., Advances in community phylogenetics improve the study of macroevolutionary constraints on coexistence by using null models that account for the geography of speciation., Although links between ecology and macroevolutionary patterns are difficult to test using a single framework, the synthesis of multiple research approaches makes it increasingly apparent that reciprocal eco-evolutionary dynamics can influence rates of diversification, phenotypic evolution, and community coexistence patterns.},

A critical step in that direction is to quantify how variation in ecological factors linked to habitat modifications might shape observed levels of genetic variability in wild populations. Still, little is known on the factors affecting levels and distribution of genetic diversity at the individual level, despite its vital underlying role in evolutionary processes. In this study, we assessed the effects of habitat quality on population structure and individual genetic diversity of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. Using a landscape genetics approach, we found that individual genetic diversity was greater in poorer quality habitats. This counter-intuitive result was partly explained by the settlement patterns of tree swallows across the landscape. Individuals of higher genetic diversity arrived earlier on their breeding grounds and settled in the first available habitats, which correspond to intensive cultures. Our results highlight the importance of investigating the effects of environmental variability on individual genetic diversity, and of integrating information on landscape structure when conducting such studies.},

These eco-evolutionary dynamics (EED) are likely to have substantial and quantifiable effects in restored habitats over timescales that are relevant for the conservation and restoration of small populations and threatened communities. Restored habitats may serve as “hotspots” for EED due to mismatches between transplanted genotypes and the restored environment, and novel interactions among lineages that do not share a coevolutionary history, both of which can generate strong selection for rapid evolutionary change that has immediate demographic consequences. Rapid evolution that influences population dynamics and community processes is likely to have particularly large effects during the establishment phase of restoration efforts. Finally, restoration activities and their associated long-term monitoring programs provide outstanding opportunities for using eco-evolutionary experimental approaches. Results from such studies will address questions about the effects of rapid evolutionary change on the ecological dynamics of populations and interacting species, while simultaneously providing critical, but currently overlooked, information for conservation practices.},

Geneticists meanwhile have identified complexities relating to the nature of genetic variation and its architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under debate.

Though perfectly legitimate and understandable, the requirement of empirical validation has been taken to extremes. The result of doing so is that potentially useful scientific investigations involving computer simulations risk being thwarted on the grounds that they are not empirically calibrated or perhaps not historically validated. We shall argue that the role that IBCM plays in integrative ecology depends on whether one is doing applied ecology with concerns such as species conservation or whether one is doing theoretical ecology. In the former case, computer modeling should incorporate real-world elements and actual experimental data if the goal is to model existing ecosystems and to make long-term predictions about these systems. In this case, IBCM functions more like an investigative tool for scientific inquiry. On the other hand, if one's concerns are more theoretical, then IBCM has value in its own right in terms of high generality and equally high predictive power. Although the modeling should be realistic in a broad sense that is consistent with species generally that evolve in a world with predation, pathogens and fluctuating resources, simulations for more theoretical investigations need not incorporate experimental data – especially in light of the fact that these are not always obtainable in the field. They are experimental systems in their own right and not merely adjunctive tools.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program.

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

Many have studied the effect of protecting many small regions of an ecosystem vs. a single large region, with varied results. However, this research tends to ignore evolutionary dynamics under the rationale that the spatiotemporal scale required is prohibitive. We used the Avida digital evolution research platform to overcome this barrier and study the response of phenotypic diversity to eight different reserve placement configurations. The capacity for mutation,and therefore evolution, substantially altered the dynamics of diversity in the population. When mutations were allowed, reserve configurations involving a greater number of consequently smaller reserves were substantially more effective at maintaining existing diversity and generating new diversity. However, when mutations were disallowed, reserve configuration had little effect on diversity generation and maintenance. While further research is necessary before translating these results into policy decisions, this study demonstrates the importance of considering evolution when making such decisions and suggests that a larger number of smaller reserves may have evolutionary benefits.},

	abstract = {Diversity is often associated with the functional stability of ecological communities from microbes to macroorganisms. Understanding how diversity responds to environmental perturbations and the consequences of this relationship for ecosystem function are thus central challenges in microbial ecology. Unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships, in which maximum diversity occurs at intermediate levels of disturbance, have been predicted for ecosystems where life history tradeoffs separate organisms along a disturbance gradient. However, empirical support for such peaked relationships in macrosystems is mixed, and few studies have explored these relationships in microbial systems. Here we use complex microbial microcosm communities to systematically determine diversity-disturbance relationships over a range of disturbance regimes. We observed a reproducible switch between community states, which gave rise to transient diversity maxima when community states were forced to mix. Communities showed reduced compositional stability when diversity was highest. To further explore these dynamics, we formulated a simple model that reveals specific regimes under which diversity maxima are stable. Together, our results show how both unimodal and non-unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships can be observed as a system switches between two distinct microbial community states; this process likely occurs across a wide range of spatially and temporally heterogeneous microbial ecosystems.
IMPORTANCE The diversity of microbial communities is linked to the functioning and stability of ecosystems. As humanity continues to impact ecosystems worldwide, and as diet and disease perturb our own commensal microbial communities, the ability to predict how microbial diversity will respond to disturbance is of critical importance. Using microbial microcosm experiments, we find that community diversity responds to different disturbance regimes in a reproducible and predictable way. Maximum diversity occurs when two communities, each suited to different environmental conditions, are mixed due to disturbance. This maximum diversity is transient except under specific regimes. Using a simple mathematical model, we show that transient unimodality is likely a common feature of microbial diversity-disturbance relationships in fluctuating environments.},

	abstract = {Animal phyla vary dramatically in species richness (from one species to {\textgreater}1.2 million), but the causes of this variation remain largely unknown. Animals have also evolved striking variation in morphology and ecology, including sessile marine taxa lacking heads, eyes, limbs, and complex organs (e.g., sponges), parasitic worms (e.g., nematodes, platyhelminths), and taxa with eyes, skeletons, limbs, and complex organs that dominate terrestrial ecosystems (arthropods, chordates). Relating this remarkable variation in traits to the diversification and richness of animal phyla is a fundamental yet unresolved problem in biology. Here, we test the impacts of 18 traits (including morphology, ecology, reproduction, and development) on diversification and richness of extant animal phyla. Using phylogenetic multiple regression, the best-fitting model includes five traits that explain ∼74\% of the variation in diversification rates (dioecy, parasitism, eyes/photoreceptors, a skeleton, nonmarine habitat). However, a model including just three (skeleton, parasitism, habitat) explains nearly as much variation (∼67\%). Diversification rates then largely explain richness patterns. Our results also identify many striking traits that have surprisingly little impact on diversification (e.g., head, limbs, and complex circulatory and digestive systems). Overall, our results reveal the key factors that shape large-scale patterns of diversification and richness across {\textgreater}80\% of all extant, described species.},

	abstract = {Author Summary For a novel genotype to establish in a population, it must (1) be created, and (2) not be subsequently lost. Recombination is a double-edged sword in this process, potentially fostering creation, but also hastening loss as the novel genotype is being recombined with other genotypes, especially when rare. In this study, we find that spatial structure may affect both the creative and destructive aspects of recombination in rugged fitness landscapes. By slowing the spread of high-fitness genotypes, spatially restricted mating and dispersal may allow diverse subpopulations to arise. Reproduction across the borders of these subpopulations—at “sutures”—may create genetic novelty. Depending on the topography of the fitness landscape, such novelty may be in the domain of attraction of a new, higher peak; the population may “peak-jump” to an area of genotype space unlikely to be explored by mutation alone. Lineages founded by peak-jumping events are particularly prone to early extinction, as recombination with unlike genotypes may disrupt the rare allele combination and thereby produce low-fitness offspring. However, these fledgling peak lineages may be protected from early extinction by mating within small homotypic clusters—in “centers”. Thus, spatial structure may allow a population to create rare genotypes via recombination, and allow those rare genotypes to persist despite recombination.},

Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock’s feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock’s spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve’s creation can give way to long-term gains.},

As species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the structure of these networks changes; this happens because species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of ecological interactions share common evolutionary mechanisms that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death processes for species interactions describes the structure of extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types of ecological interactions we considered--seed dispersal, herbivory, parasitism, bacteriophagy, and pollination--only differed in the position they occupy in the parameters' multi-dimensional space. Notably, we found no clustering of parameters values between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Our results provide a common modelling framework for the evolution of ecological networks that we anticipate will contribute to the greater consideration of the explicit role played by species interactions in models of macro-evolution and adaptive radiations.},

Patterns of fitness variation in the field can show whether natural selection drives local adaptation and ecotype formation. However, to demonstrate a link between ecological divergence and speciation, local adaptation must have consequences for reproductive isolation. Using contrasting ecotypes of an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus in common garden experiments, hybridization experiments, and reciprocal transplants, we assessed how the environment shapes patterns of adaptation and the consequences of adaptive divergence for reproductive isolation. Local adaptation was strong between ecotypes, but weaker between populations of the same ecotype. F1 hybrids exhibited heterosis, but crosses involving one native parent performed better than those with two foreign parents. In a common garden experiment, F2 hybrids exhibited reduced fitness compared to parentals and F1 hybrids, suggesting that few genetic incompatibilities have accumulated between populations adapted to contrasting environments. Our results show how ecological differences across the landscape have created complex patterns of local adaptation and reproductive isolation, suggesting that divergent natural selection has played a fundamental role in the early stages of species diversification.},

	abstract = {The relationship between structure and stability in ecological networks and the effect of spatial dynamics on natural communities have both been major foci of ecological research for decades. Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species’ spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

It predicted BSD for a series of similar brushlands where other indices had failed. Species richness increased faster than species overlap in a series of increasing complex habitats up to the forest stage. Species overlap was negatively correlated with patchiness. Additional species may be accommodated in preforest habitats primarily by horizontal spatial segregation facilitate by the presence of additional patches. New patches result from the addition of layers of vegetation. In late shrub or forest stages other kinds of segregation such as vertical segregation become important to species packing. Patchiness, as measured here, has a proximate effect on avian diversity. The extent or existence of latitudinal gradients in habitat patchiness and the effect on bird species diversity is unknown. The need remains for a universal simple, yet meaningful, heterogeneity index which incorporates both horizontal and vertical variability of vegetation.},

	abstract = {Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies {\textasciitilde}30\% of deaths worldwide, including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of {\textasciitilde}500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.02.009},
	abstract = {The SLOSS debate – whether a single large reserve will conserve more species than several small – of the 1970s and 1980s never came to a resolution. The first rule of reserve design states that one large reserve will conserve the most species, a rule which has been heavily contested. Empirical data seem to undermine the reliance on general rules, indicating that the best strategy varies from case to case. Modeling has also been deployed in this debate. We may divide the modeling approaches to the SLOSS enigma into dynamic and static approaches. Dynamic approaches, covered by the fields of island equilibrium theory of island biogeography and metapopulation theory, look at immigration, emigration, and extinction. Static approaches, such as the one in this paper, illustrate how several factors affect the number of reserves that will save the most species.

This article approaches the effect of different factors by the application of species-diversity models. These models combine species–area curves for two or more reserves, correcting for the species overlap between them. Such models generate several predictions on how different factors affect the optimal number of reserves. The main predictions are: Fewer and larger reserves are favored by increased species overlap between reserves, by faster growth in number of species with reserve area increase, by higher minimum-area requirements, by spatial aggregation and by uneven species abundances. The effect of increased distance between smaller reserves depends on the two counteracting factors: decreased species density caused by isolation (which enhances minimum-area effect) and decreased overlap between isolates. The first decreases the optimal number of reserves; the second increases the optimal number. The effect of total reserve-system area depends both on the shape of the species–area curve and on whether overlap between reserves changes with scale.

The approach to modeling presented here has several implications for conservational strategies. It illustrates well how the SLOSS enigma can be reduced to a question of the shape of the species–area curve that is expected or generated from reserves of different sizes and a question of overlap between isolates (or reserves).},

Because multiple evolutionary processes interact to generate quantitative variation in the degree of local maladaptation, we focus on how studying the ecological effects of maladaptation will lead to a more comprehensive view of how evolution can influence ecology. We explore how maladaptation can influence ecology through the lens of island biogeography theory, which yields some novel predictions, such as patch isolation increasing species richness.},

Habitat conversion continues in most parts of the world, especially in areas of high species richness, and novel threats, especially climate change, will pose new challenges. With this pressure, maintaining evolutionary processes in natural populations will be critical to longer term persistence, and will often require specific planning relevant to the context. However, in many areas of policy and practice, urgent actions tend to focus on pattern-based analyses and considerations of evolutionary and ecological processes are neglected. At a variety of levels, from setting goals to implementing conservation management at the site or species level, there are simple adjustments that can be made. Improved methods for integrating the work of scientists and policymakers is recommended, from the beginning to end of the planning process.},

During the breeding season, the shearwaters build their nests on off-shore islands. While one parent tends the nest, the other flies out to sea in search of food. A crucial question in Klomp’s research was how the bird populations interacted with the marine species they feed on. He used a combination of tracking satellites and small transponders attached to the birds to track where they flew within their nesting territories. To everyone’s surprise, data returned by the new technology showed that instead of making short sorties close to their nests, the shearwaters undertake long migrations (Klomp et al. 1997; Klomp and Schultz 2000). They travel several thousand kilometres to and from Antarctica each year during the southern hemisphere summer (Figure 10-1). Klomp’s discovery had many implications, not only about the ecology of shearwaters, but also about species interactions and food webs in Antarctic waters.},

Here, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the dynamics of adaptation and substitution over all mutation-rate regimes by conceptualizing the population as a collection of continuously adapting lineages. This model of “lineage interference” shows that each new mutant’s advantage over the rest of the population must be above a critical threshold in order to likely achieve fixation, and we derive a simple expression for that threshold. We apply this framework to examine the role of beneficial mutations with different effect sizes across the transition to the multiple-mutations regime.},

	abstract = {Species may often exhibit geographic variation in population genetic structure due to contemporary and historical variation in population size and gene flow. Here, we test the predictions that populations on the margins of a species’ distribution contain less genetic variation and are more differentiated than populations towards the core of the range by comparing patterns of genetic variation at five microsatellite loci between disjunct and core populations of the perennial, allohexaploid herb Geum triflorum. We sampled nine populations isolated on alvar habitat within the eastern Great Lakes region in North America, habitats that include disjunct populations of several plant species, and compared these to 16 populations sampled from prairie habitat throughout the core of the species’ distribution in midwestern Canada and the USA. Alvar populations exhibited much lower within-population diversity and contained only a subset of alleles found in prairie populations. We detected isolation by distance across the species’ range and within alvar and prairie regions separately. As predicted, genetic differentiation was higher among alvar populations than among prairie populations, even after controlling for the geographic distance between sampled populations. Low diversity and high differentiation can be accounted for by the greater contemporary spatial isolation of alvar populations. However, the genetic structure of alvar populations may also have been influenced by postglacial range expansion and contraction. Our results are consistent with alvar populations being founded during an expansion of prairie habitat during the warmer, hypsithermal period ∼5000 bp and subsequently becoming stranded on isolated alvar habitat as the climate grew cooler and wetter.},

	abstract = {In the basic fitness landscape metaphor for molecular evolution, evolutionary pathways are presumed to follow uphill steps of increasing fitness. How evolution can cross fitness valleys is an open question. One possibility is that environmental changes alter the fitness landscape such that low-fitness sequences reside on a hill in alternate environments. We experimentally test this hypothesis on the antibiotic resistance gene TEM-15 β-lactamase by comparing four evolutionary strategies shaped by environmental changes. The strategy that included initial steps of selecting for low antibiotic resistance (negative selection) produced superior alleles compared with the other three strategies. We comprehensively examined possible evolutionary pathways leading to one such high-fitness allele and found that an initially deleterious mutation is key to the allele’s evolutionary history. This mutation is an initial gateway to an otherwise relatively inaccessible area of sequence space and participates in higher-order, positive epistasis with a number of neutral to slightly beneficial mutations. The ability of negative selection and environmental changes to provide access to novel fitness peaks has important implications for natural evolutionary mechanisms and applied directed evolution.
Epistatic interactions and changes in the selection environment facilitate the experimental evolution of β-lactamase.

Due to the recent formation of the PAG and its subsequent shift to a hot climate, these corals have had only {\textless}6,000 y to adapt to these extreme conditions and can therefore inform on how coral reefs may respond to global warming. One key to coral survival in the world’s warmest reefs are symbioses with a newly discovered alga, Symbiodinium thermophilum. Currently, it is unknown whether this symbiont originated elsewhere or emerged from unexpectedly fast evolution catalyzed by the extreme environment. Analyzing genetic diversity of symbiotic algae across {\textgreater}5,000 km of the PAG, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea coastline, we show that S. thermophilum is a member of a highly diverse, ancient group of symbionts cryptically distributed outside the PAG. We argue that the adjustment to temperature extremes by PAG corals was facilitated by the positive selection of preadapted symbionts. Our findings suggest that maintaining the largest possible pool of potentially stress-tolerant genotypes by protecting existing biodiversity is crucial to promote rapid adaptation to present-day climate change, not only for coral reefs, but for ecosystems in general.},

	abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines in water clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430–US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

Despite that, genetic information is largely neglected in conservation planning, and how conservation units should be defined is still heatedly debated. Here, we use maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), an outcrossing long lived tree with a highly fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, to prove the importance of accounting for genetic variation - at both neutral molecular markers and quantitative traits - to define useful conservation units. Six gene pools associated to distinct evolutionary histories were identified within the species using 12 microsatellites and 266 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, height and survival standing variation, their genetic control and plasticity were assessed in a multisite clonal common garden experiment (16,544 trees). We found high levels of quantitative genetic differentiation within previously defined neutral gene pools. Subsequent cluster analysis and post-hoc trait distribution comparisons allowed us to define ten genetically homogeneous population groups with high evolutionary potential. They constitute the minimum number of units to be represented in a maritime pine dynamic conservation program. Our results uphold that the identification of conservation units below the species level should account for key neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, especially in species with strong population structure and complex evolutionary histories. The environmental zonation approach currently used by the pan-European genetic conservation strategy for forest trees would be largely improved by gradually integrating molecular and quantitative trait information, as data become available.

Strategies compete against each other during each generation, and successful strategies contribute more of their attributes to the next generation. Each strategy is encoded on a ‘chromosome’ that plays the IPD, responding to the sequences of most recent responses by the interacting individuals (chromosomes). The analysis reported in this paper considered different memory capabilities (one to five previous interactions), pairing continuities (pairs of individuals remain together for about one, two, five, or 1000 consecutive interactions), and types of individual recognition (recognition capability was maximal, nil, or allowed to evolve between these limits). Analysis of the results focused on the frequency of mutual cooperation in pairwise interactions (a good indicator of overall success in the IPD) and on the extent to which previous responses by the focal individual and its partner were associated with the partner's identity (individual recognition). Results indicated that a fixed, substantial amount of individual recognition could maintain high levels of mutual cooperation even at low pairing continuities, and a significant but limited capability for individual recognition evolved under selection. Recognition generally increased mutual cooperation more when the recent responses of individuals other than the current partner were ignored. Titrating recognition memory under selection using a fitness cost suggested that memory of the partner's previous responses was more valuable than memory of the focal's previous responses. The dynamics produced to date by EvCo are a step toward understanding the evolution of social networks, for which additional benefits associated with group interactions must be incorporated.},

Abstract
Rapid evolution challenges the assumption that evolution is too slow to impact short-term ecological dynamics. This insight motivates the study of ‘Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics’ or how evolution and ecological processes reciprocally interact on short time scales. We tested how rapid evolution impacts concurrent population dynamics using an aphid (Myzus persicae) and an undomesticated host (Hirschfeldia incana) in replicated wild populations. We manipulated evolvability by creating non-evolving (single clone) and potentially evolving (two-clone) aphid populations that contained genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate. We observed significant evolution in two-clone populations whether or not they were exposed to predators and competitors. Evolving populations grew up to 42\% faster and attained up to 67\% higher density, compared with non-evolving control populations but only in treatments exposed to competitors and predators. Increased density also correlates with relative fitness of competing clones suggesting a full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle defined as reciprocal interactions between evolution and density.},

The Glanville fritillary butterfly has a large extant metapopulation in the Åland Islands in Finland, but declined to extinction in the nearby fragmented southwestern (SW) Finnish archipelago in the 20th century. We genotyped museum samples for 222 SNPs across the genome, including SNPs from candidate genes and neutral regions. SW Finnish populations had significantly reduced genetic diversity before extinction, and their allele frequencies gradually diverged from those in contemporary Åland populations over 80 y. We identified 15 outlier loci among candidate SNPs, mostly related to flight, in which allele frequencies have changed more than the neutral expectation. At outlier loci, allele frequencies in SW Finland shifted in the same direction as newly established populations deviated from old local populations in contemporary Åland. Moreover, outlier allele frequencies in SW Finland resemble those in fragmented landscapes as opposed to continuous landscapes in the Baltic region. These results indicate selection for genotypes associated with good colonization capacity in the highly fragmented landscape before the extinction of the populations. Evolutionary response to habitat fragmentation may have enhanced the viability of the populations, but it did not save the species from regional extinction in the face of severe habitat loss and fragmentation. These results highlight a potentially common situation in changing environments: evolutionary changes are not strong enough to fully compensate for the direct adverse effects of environmental change and thereby rescue populations from extinction.},

	abstract = {The traditional way of identifying targets of adaptive evolution has been to study a few loci that one hypothesizes a priori to have been under selection. This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research.},

	abstract = {Recent research has revealed that evolution often occurs on contemporary timescales, often within decades. Contemporary evolution is associated with the same factors that are driving the current extinction crisis: habitat loss and degradation, overharvesting and exotic species. Thus, it is relevant to many conservation situations. First, habitat fragmentation might influence the potential of a population to adapt in response environmental degradation. Second, certain harvesting strategies can result in the evolution of life-history traits, ultimately resulting in negative impacts on harvestable yield. Third, the establishment of exotic species can be influenced by their adaptive potential and our ability to limit that potential. Furthermore, contemporary evolution is of concern for intensively managed species, because it might reduce their fitness in native habitats. Ultimately, contemporary evolution is influenced by complex interactions among population size, genetic variation, the strength of selection, and gene flow, making most management scenarios unique. In a world filled with contemporary evolution, conservation efforts that ignore its implications will be less efficient and perhaps even risk prone.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of nature reserves has been a hotly debated topic for some years. One contentious issue has concerned the ideal shape of reserves, with several researchers suggesting that reserves should be as nearly circular as possible to minimize edge-related degredation and potential ‘peninsularity’ effects. This paper demonstrates an advantage to non-circular reserves: given the spatial autocorrelation of environmental conditions and species ranges, elongated samples should tend to capture a greater diversity of conditions and, consequently, a greater number of species. To test this idea, samples of 16 cells, arranged as 4 × 4 squares, 2 × 8 rectangles and 1 × 16 lines were considered in mapped plant distributions at spatial scales ranging from cells of 1 m2 to 2500 km2. Overall, elongated samples tended to capture significantly larger numbers of species than did their square counterparts, as predicted. The degree of elongated sample advantage was very similar at all but the smallest of the scales considered, suggesting that the pattern of species turnover (β-diversity) is nearly scale-independent or fractal in nature. As the advantages of elongation are largely scale-independent and the only documented disadvantages (edge effects) are very scale-dependent, the optimal shape of a reserve for species sampling should shift as a function of reserve size, with large reserves becoming increasingly elongated.},

Its main purpose is to present simple mathematical and graphical models on how landscape patterns affect species numbers. The idea is to build models of species diversity in multi-habitat landscapes by combining species-area curves for different habitats. Predictions are made about how variables such as species richness and species overlap between habitats influence the proportion of the total landscape each habitat should constitute, and how many habitats it should be divided into in order to be able to sustain the maximal number of species. Habitat size and numbers are the only factors discussed here, not habitat spatial patterns. Among the predictions are: 1) where there are differences in species diversity between habitats, optimal landscape patterns contain larger proportions of species rich habitats. 2) Species overlap between habitats shifts the optimum further towards larger proportions of species rich habitat types. 3) Species overlap also shifts the optimum towards fewer habitat types. 4) Species diversity in landscapes with large species overlap is more resistant to changes in landscape (or reserve) size. This type of model approach can produce theories useful to nature and landscape management in general, and the design of nature reserves and national parks in particular.},

I show that sweeps can increase, decrease, or even eliminate linkage disequilibrium (LD) entirely depending on the relative position of the selected and neutral loci. I also show the importance of the age of the neutral mutations in predicting their degree of association and describe the consequences of such results for the interpretation of empirical data. In particular, I demonstrate that while selective sweeps can eliminate LD, they generate patterns of genetic variation very different from those expected from recombination hotspots.},

In principle, it should be possible to identify chromosomal regions involved in adaptive divergence by screening genome-wide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect the locus-specific signature of positive directional selection. In the case of spatially separated populations that inhabit different environments or sympatric populations that exploit different ecological niches, it is possible to identify loci that underlie divergently selected traits by comparing relative levels of differentiation among large numbers of unlinked markers. In this review I first address the question of whether diversifying selection on polygenic traits can be expected to produce predictable patterns of allelic variation at the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL), and whether the locus-specific effects of selection can be reliably detected against the genome-wide backdrop of stochastic variability. I then review different approaches that have been developed to identify loci involved in adaptive population divergence and I discuss the relative merits of model-based approaches that rely on assumptions about population structure vs. model-free approaches that are based on empirical distributions of summary statistics. Finally, I consider the evolutionary and functional insights that might be gained by conducting genome scans for loci involved in adaptive population divergence.},

When it occurs, adaptive radiation typically follows the colonization of a new environment or the establishment of a “key innovation,” which opens new ecological niches and/or new paths for evolution. Here, we take advantage of recent developments in speciation theory and modern computing power to build and explore a large-scale, stochastic, spatially explicit, individual-based model of adaptive radiation driven by adaptation to multidimensional ecological niches. We are able to model evolutionary dynamics of populations with hundreds of thousands of sexual diploid individuals over a time span of 100,000 generations assuming realistic mutation rates and allowing for genetic variation in a large number of both selected and neutral loci. Our results provide theoretical support and explanation for a number of empirical patterns including “area effect,” “overshooting effect,” and “least action effect,” as well as for the idea of a “porous genome.” Our findings suggest that the genetic architecture of traits involved in the most spectacular radiations might be rather simple. We show that a great majority of speciation events are concentrated early in the phylogeny. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological opportunity and genetic constraints in controlling the dynamics of adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the root causes of many conservation problems. We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of dge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the "expected" manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (⩾14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.},

We tested whether several small or single large habitat fragments (re-visiting the ‘single large or several small’ debate) support more species across a wide range of taxonomic groups (plants, leafhoppers, true bugs, snails). Our study comprised 14 small ({\textless}1 ha) and 14 large (1.5–8 ha) fragments of calcareous grassland in Central Germany along orthogonal gradients of landscape complexity and habitat connectivity. Each taxon was sampled on six plots per fragment. Across taxa, species richness did not differ between large and small fragments, whereas species-area accumulation curves showed that both overall and specialist species richness was much higher on several small fragments of calcareous grassland than on few large fragments. On average, 85 \% of the overall species richness was recorded on all small fragments taken together (4.6 ha), whereas the two largest ones (15.1 ha) only accounted for 37 \% of the species. This could be due to the greater geographic extent covered by many small fragments. However, community composition differed strongly between large and small fragments, and some of the rarest specialist species appeared to be confined to large fragments. The surrounding landscape did not show any consistent effects on species richness and community composition. Our results show that both single large and many small fragments are needed to promote landscape-wide biodiversity across taxa. We therefore question the focus on large fragments only and call for a new diversified habitat fragmentation strategy for biodiversity conservation.},

There is no other recent textbook devoted solely to island biogeography, and a synthesis of the many recent advances is now overdue. This second edition builds on the success and reputation of the first, documenting the recent advances in this exciting field and explaining how islands have been used as natural laboratories in developing and testing ecological and evolutionary theories. In addition, the book describes the main processes of island formation, development and eventual demise, and explains the relevance of island environmental history to island biogeography. The authors demonstrate the huge significance of islands as hotspots of biodiversity, and as places from which disproportionate numbers of species have been extinguished by human action in historical time.

The observed cooperation between genes, cells, tissues, and higher organisms represents a paradox for Darwinian evolution, because the individual success of cheating is rewarded before its long-term detrimental consequences are felt. The tension between cooperation and defection can be represented by a simple game (the “Prisoner's Dilemma”), which has been used to study the conflicts between decisions to cooperate or defect. Here, we encode these decisions within genes, and allow them to adapt to environments that differ in how well a player can predict how an opponent is going to play. We find that evolutionary paths end at strategies that cooperate if the environment is sufficiently predictable, while they end in defection in uncertain and inconsistent worlds because inconsistency favors defection over cooperation. This work shows that cooperation or defection, in populations of players that use the information from previous moves to plan future ones, can be influenced by changing the environmental parameters.},

The four possible combinations of random and fitness-based emigration and replacement of existing individuals are considered. The investigation follows two approaches. The first is to calculate the takeover time under the four migration policies. This approach makes several simplifying assumptions, but the qualitative conclusions that are derived from the calculations are confirmed by the second approach. The second approach consists on quantifying the increase in the selection intensity. The selection intensity is a domain-independent adimensional quantity that can be used to compare the selection pressure of common selection methods with the pressure caused by migration. The results may help to avoid excessively high (or low) selection pressures that may cause the search to fail, and offer a plausible explanation to the frequent claims of superlinear speedups in parallel EAs.

	abstract = {As genetic algorithms (GAs) become increasingly popular, they are applied to difficult problems that may require considerable computations. In such cases, parallel implementations of GAs become necessary to reach high-quality solutions in reasonable times. But, even though their mechanics are simple, parallel GAs are complex non-linear algorithms that are controlled by many parameters, which are not well understood.  Efficient and Accurate Parallel Genetic Algorithms is about the design of parallel GAs. It presents theoretical developments that improve our understanding of the effect of the algorithm's parameters on its search for quality and efficiency. These developments are used to formulate guidelines on how to choose the parameter values that minimize the execution time while consistently reaching solutions of high quality.  Efficient and Accurate Parallel Genetic Algorithms can be read in several ways, depending on the readers' interests and their previous knowledge about these algorithms. Newcomers to the field will find the background material in each chapter useful to become acquainted with previous work, and to understand the problems that must be faced to design efficient and reliable algorithms. Potential users of parallel GAs that may have doubts about their practicality or reliability may be more confident after reading this book and understanding the algorithms better. Those who are ready to try a parallel GA on their applications may choose to skim through the background material, and use the results directly without following the derivations in detail. These readers will find that using the results can help them to choose the type of parallel GA that best suits their needs, without having to invest the time to implement and test various options. Once that is settled, even the most experienced users dread the long and frustrating experience of configuring their algorithms by trial and error. The guidelines contained herein will shorten dramatically the time spent tweaking the algorithm, although some experimentation may still be needed for fine-tuning.  Efficient and Accurate Parallel Genetic Algorithms is suitable as a secondary text for a graduate level course, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.},

	abstract = {Research on fragmented ecosystems has focused mostly on the biogeographic consequences of the creation of habitat "islands" of different sizes, and has provided little of practical value to managers. However, ecosystem fragmentation causes large changes in the physical environment as well as biogeographic changes. Fragmentation generally results in a landscape that consists of remnant areas of native vegetation surrounded by a matrix of agricultural or other developed land. As a result, fluxes of radiation, momentum (i.e., wind), water, and nutrients across the landscape are altered significantly. These in turn can have important influences on the biota within remnant areas, especially at or near the edge between the remnant and the surrounding matrix. The isolation of remnant areas by clearing also has important consequences for the biota. These consequences vary with the time since isolation, distance from other remnants, and degree of connectivity with other remnants. The influences of physical and biogeographic changes are modified by the size, shape, and position in the landscape of individual remnants, with larger remnants being less adversely affected by the fragmentation process. The dynamics of remnant areas are predominantly driven by factors arising in the surrounding landscape. Management of, and research on, fragmented ecosystems should be directed at understanding and controlling these external influences as much as at the biota of the remnants themselves. There is a strong need to develop an integrated approach to landscape management that places conservation reserves in the context of the overall landscape.},

Alternative systems of conservation areas are predictions about effective ways of promoting the persistence of biodiversity; therefore, they should consider not only biodiversity pattern but also the ecological and evolutionary processes that maintain and generate species. Most research and application, however, has focused on pattern representation only. This paper outlines the development of a conservation system designed to preserve biodiversity pattern and process in the context of a rapidly changing environment. The study area is the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), a biodiversity hotspot of global significance, located in southwestern Africa. This region has experienced rapid (post-Pliocene) ecological diversification of many plant lineages; there are numerous genera with large clusters of closely related species (flocks) that have subdivided habitats at a very fine scale. The challenge is to design conservation systems that will preserve both the pattern of large numbers of species and various natural processes, including the potential for lineage turnover. We outline an approach for designing a system of conservation areas to incorporate the spatial components of the evolutionary processes that maintain and generate biodiversity in the CFR. We discuss the difficulty of assessing the requirements for pattern versus process representation in the face of ongoing threats to biodiversity, the difficulty of testing the predictions of alternative conservation systems, and the widespread need in conservation planning to incorporate and set targets for the spatial components (or surrogates) of processes.},

We review the evolutionary challenges of managing populations in the Anthropocene and introduce the concept of prescriptive evolution, which considers how evolutionary processes may be leveraged to proactively promote wise management. We advocate the planned management of evolutionary processes and explore the advantages of evolutionary interventions to preserve and sustain biodiversity. We show how an evolutionary perspective to conserving biodiversity is fundamental to effective management. Finally, we advocate building frameworks for decision-making, monitoring, and implementation at the boundary between management and evolutionary science to enhance conservation outcomes.},

In this book, the authors developed a general theory to explain the facts of island biogeography. The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species. In a new preface, Edward O. Wilson reviews the origins and consequences of this classic book.},

	abstract = {A system of natural reserves, each surrounded by altered habitat, resembles a system of islands from the point of view of species restricted to natural habitats. Recent advances in island biogeography may provide a detailed basis for understanding what to expect of such a system of reserves. The main conclusions are as follows: The number of species that a reserve can hold at equilibrium is a function of its area and its isolation. Larger reserves, and reserves located close to other reserves, can hold more species. If most of the area of a habitat is destroyed, and a fraction of the area is saved as a reserve, the reserve will initially contain more species than it can hold at equilibrium. The excess will gradually go extinct. The smaller the reserve, the higher will be the extinction rates. Estimates of these extinction rates for bird and mammal species have recently become available in a few cases. Different species require different minimum areas to have a reasonable chance of survival. Some geometric design principles are suggested in order to optimise the function of reserves in saving species.},

At the same time, ecological evidence from biological invasions, experiments, and diversity analyses strongly supports the openness of communities to new species.

Despite a declining rate of fitness gain, molecular evolution continues to be characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present new evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

I suggest that it is the tendency of lineages to maintain their ancestral ecological niche (phylogenetic niche conservatism) and their failure to adapt to new environments which frequently isolates incipient species and begins the process of speciation. Niche conservatism may be an important and widespread component of allopatric speciation but is largely unstudied. The perspective outlined here suggests roles for key microevolutionary processes (i.e., natural selection, adaptation) that are strikingly different from those proposed in previous literature on ecology and speciation. Yet, this perspective is complementary to the traditional view because it focuses on a different temporal stage of the speciation process.},

	abstract = {Ecologic determination, working through natural selection, is all-pervasive in the processes of speciation, including the aspects of speed of differentiation. Cycles in numbers of individuals that are ecologically dictated, and other small-population effects that are partly ecological, promote elevation of gene combinations to significant levels of occurrence in the population and permit mass trials and recombinations. The faster and more frequent such exploratory genetic drift, the better the chance of an early attainment of a workable new combination that may be seized upon and perfected by selection. Ecologic contrasts on borders of continents in areas of diverse topography and with pronounced hygrogradients are extraordinarily potent in race formation in terrestrial vertebrates. Without potency there can be no great speed of differentiation. The close proximity of racial differentiates, of differing population densities, greatly favors numerous and quick introgressive contacts resulting from geologic and ecologic disturbances that break down barriers. Races may be modified through exchange to arrive at favorable adaptive and compatible gene complexes and the allopatric semispecies already attained can yield species with important phyletic futures through testing under continental rigor and by borrowing improvements via introgression. Moderate innate ecologic tolerances of species rather than either sharp restriction or eurotopy seem to favor rapid polytypic diversification. Concomitantly, moderate but not full isolation of populations favors prompt initial and subsequent evolutionary progress as made particularly clear by Sewall Wright. These 'middle-ground' interpretations in which balance in the many factors of evolution is stressed might be termed the moderation thesis. Such a thesis is wholly consonant with the view that the diverse topography of continental borders promotes rapid speciation through isolative and selective mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complimentary to this, many scientists have realized the need for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots ).

	abstract = {The origin of most animal phyla and classes during the Cambrian explosion has been hypothesized to represent an ‘early burst’ of evolutionary exploration of functional ecological possibilities. However, the ecological history of marine animals has yet to be fully quantified, preventing an assessment of the early-burst model for functional ecology. Here we use ecological assignments for 18,621 marine animal genera to assess the relative timing of functional differentiation versus taxonomic diversification from the Cambrian to the present day. We find that functional diversity increased more slowly than would be expected given the history of taxonomic diversity. Contrary to previous inferences of rapid ecological differentiation from the early appearances of all well-fossilized phyla and classes, explicit coding of functional characteristics demonstrates that Cambrian genera occupied comparatively few modes of life. Functional diversity increased in the Ordovician and, especially, during the recoveries from the end-Permian and end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. Permanent shifts in the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity following the era-bounding extinctions indicates a critical role for these biotic crises in coupling taxonomic and functional diversity.},

The usual analysis according to which noncooperation is considered the rational strategy for classical 2-prisoners' dilemma is logically similar to Olson's analysis, which suggests that rational members of a latent group should not contribute toward the purchase of the group collective good. However, in the game analysis it is clear that the latent and intermediate groups are not logically different, but rather are distinguishable only statistically. Some prisoners' dilemma experimental results are used to suggest how the difference might arise and how the vast prisoners' dilemma literature can be related to the problem of collective action. The game of collective action is then analyzed not from the view of strategies but of outcomes. There is presented a theorem which states that the outcome in which all player-members of a group pay and all benefit is a Condorcet choice from the set of realizable outcomes for the game. Hence the cooperative outcome in such a game would prevail in election against all other outcomes.},

These include explanations assuming different degrees of competition, mutualism, predation, epiphyte load, epidemics, biotic spatial heterogeneity, host diversity, population size, niche width, population growth rate, environmental harshness, and patchiness at different latitudes. Other explanations are not supported by sufficient evidence, i.e. there is no consistent correlation between species diversity and environmental stability, environmental predictability, productivity, abiotic rarefaction, physical heterogeneity, latitudinal decrease in the angle of the sun above the horizon, area, aridity, seasonality, number of habitats, and latitudinal ranges. The ecological and evolutionary time hypotheses, as usually understood, also cannot explain the gradients, nor does the temperature dependence of chemical reactions permit predictions on species richness. Only differences in solar energy are consistently correlated with diversity gradients along latitude, altitude and perhaps depth. It is concluded that greater species diversity is due to greater "effective" evolutionary time (evolutionary speed) in the tropics, probably as the result of shorter generation times, faster mutation rates, and faster selection at greater temperatures. There is an urgent need for experimental studies of temperature effects on speed of selection.},

While the PMM model has been the backbone for our advances in landscape ecology, it may also hamper truly universal insights into process–pattern relationships.

The PMM describes landscape structures as a mosaic of discretely delineated homogenous areas. This requires simplifications and assumptions which may even result in errors which propagate through subsequent analyses and may reduce our ability to understand effects of landscape structure on ecological processes. Alternative approaches to represent landscape structure should therefore be evaluated. The GM represents continuous surface characteristics without arbitrary vegetation or land-use classification and therefore does not require delineation of discrete areas with sharp boundaries. The GM therefore lends itself to be a more realistic representation of a particular surface characteristic. In the paper PMM and GM are compared regarding their prospects and limitations. Suggestions are made regarding the potential use and implementation of both approaches for process–pattern analysis.

The ecological and anthropogenic process itself and its characteristics under investigation is decisive for: (i) the selection of discrete and/or continuous indicators, (ii) the type of the quantitative pattern analysis approach to be used (PMM/GM) and (iii) the data and the scale required in the analysis. Process characteristics and their effects on pattern characteristics in space and time are decisive for the applicability of the PMM or of the GM approach. A low hemeroby (high naturalness and low human pressure on landscapes) allows for high internal-heterogeneity in space and over time within patterns. Such landscapes can be captured with the GM approach. A high hemeroby reduces heterogeneity in space and time within patterns. For such landscapes we recommend the PMM model.},

To reveal how habitat fragmentation determines dispersal and dispersal-related morphology in a ground-dispersing insect species we used a bush-cricket (Pholidoptera griseoaptera) which is associated with forest-edge habitat. We analysed spatial genetic patterns together with variability of the phenotype in two forested landscapes with different levels of fragmentation. While spatial configuration of forest habitats did not negatively affect genetic characteristics related to the fitness of sampled populations, genetic differentiation was found higher among populations from an extensive forest. Compared to an agricultural matrix between forest patches, the matrix of extensive forest had lower permeability and posed barriers for the dispersal of this species. Landscape configuration significantly affected also morphological traits that are supposed to account for species dispersal potential; individuals from fragmented forest patches had longer hind femurs and a higher femur to pronotum ratio. This result suggests that selection pressure act differently on populations from both landscape types since dispersal-related morphology was related to the level of habitat fragmentation. Thus observed patterns may be explained as plastic according to the level of landscape configuration; while anthropogenic fragmentation of habitats for this species can lead to homogenization of spatial genetic structure.},

This variation is particularly ecological relevant if it encompasses a functional separation of short- (SDD) and long-distance dispersal (LDD). It remains, however, an open question whether both parts of the dispersal kernel are similarly affected by landscape related selection pressures. We implemented an individual-based model to analyze the evolution of dispersal traits in fractal landscapes that vary in the proportion of habitat and its spatial configuration. Individuals are parthenogenetic with dispersal distance determined by two alleles on each individual's genome: one allele coding for the probability of global dispersal and one allele coding for the variance σ of a Gaussian local dispersal with mean value zero. Simulations show that mean distances of local dispersal and the probability of global dispersal, increase with increasing habitat availability, but that changes in the habitat's spatial autocorrelation impose opposing selective pressure: local dispersal distances decrease and global dispersal probabilities increase with decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the available habitat. Local adaptation of local dispersal distance emerges in landscapes with less than 70\% of clumped habitat. These results demonstrate that long and short distance dispersal evolve separately according to different properties of the landscape. The landscape structure may consequently largely affect the evolution of dispersal distance strategies and the level of dispersal polymorphism.},

We find a persistence threshold which depends on the leading eigenvalue of the matrix describing dispersal success between each pair of patches and show that this eigenvalue exceeds the mean dispersal success. An averaged approximation that uses a single statistic to describe each path, rather than the full matrix, successfully predicts the regional population size produced by the simulation and predicts a simple linear relationship between this statistic and the patch immigration rate.

Specifically, we analysed whether evolution can favour different, co-existing, behavioural search strategies within one population and to what extent this coexistence of multiple strategies was dependent on landscape configuration. Using an individual-based simulation model, we studied the evolution of patch searching strategies in three different landscape configurations: uniform, random and clumped. We found that landscape configuration strongly influenced the evolved search strategy. In uniform landscapes, one fixed search strategy evolved for the entire spatially structured population, while in random and clumped landscapes, a set of different search strategies emerged. The coexistence of several search strategies also strongly depended on the dispersal mortality. We show that our result can affect landscape connectivity and metapopulation dynamics.},

This is challenging because macroevolution typically uses lineage-based models, whereas ecology often focuses on individual organisms. Here, we develop a new parsimonious individual-based theory by adding mild selection to the neutral theory of biodiversity. We show that this model generates realistic phylogenies showing a slowdown in diversification and also improves on the ecological predictions of neutral theory by explaining the occurrence of very common species. Moreover, we find the distribution of individual fitness changes over time, with average fitness increasing at a pace that depends positively on community size. Consequently, large communities tend to produce fitter species than smaller communities. These findings have broad implications beyond biodiversity theory, potentially impacting, for example, invasion biology and paleontology.},

Here we investigate the population genetic structure of wild populations of the plant pathogen Melampsora lini on its host Linum marginale, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, two genes underlying pathogen virulence, and phenotypic variation in virulence. In Australia, M. lini occurs as two genetically and geographically divergent lineages (AA and AB), one of which is completely asexual (AB), and the other able to reproduce both clonally and sexually (AA). To quantify the genetic and evolutionary consequences of these different life histories, we sampled five populations in each of two biogeographical regions. Analysis of AFLP data obtained for 275 isolates revealed largely disjunct geographical distributions for the two different lineages, low genetic diversity within lineages, and strong genetic structure among populations within each region. We also detected significant divergence among populations for both Avr genes and virulence phenotypes, although generally these values were lower than those obtained with AFLP markers. Furthermore, isolates belonging to lineage AA collectively harboured significantly higher genotypic and phenotypic diversity than lineage AB isolates. Together these results illustrate the important roles of reproductive modes and geographical structure in the generation and maintenance of virulence diversity in populations of M. lini.},

	abstract = {We show that the relationship between variance in population energy use and variance in species abundance depends critically on the model of causal relationships among metabolic rate, body size, and population density assumed, provided that they specify alternative paths of error propagation. It has been claimed that the allometric relationship between population density and body size indicates that species within communities use resources less equitably than would be inferred from a particular species abundance distribution. Our analysis of 41 local bird communities shows that this claim is supported only if it is assumed that both body size and metabolic rate are a consequence of population density. A more realistic model that assumes a causal role for body size as affecting metabolic rate and population density provides estimates of variance in population energy use that closely match the pattern of variance in population density. This implies that the apportionment of individuals and resources, among species, are equivalent processes.},

We capitalised on historical Trinidadian guppy transplant experiments to test the phenotypic effects of increased gene flow caused by replicated introductions of adaptively divergent guppies, which were translocated from high- to low-predation environments. We sampled two native populations prior to the onset of gene flow, six historic introduction sites, introduction sources and multiple downstream points in each basin. Extensive gene flow from introductions occurred in all streams, yet adaptive phenotypic divergence across a gradient in predation level was maintained. Descendants of guppies from a high-predation source site showed high phenotypic similarity with native low-predation guppies in as few as {\textasciitilde}12 generations after gene flow, likely through a combination of adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity. Our results demonstrate that locally adapted phenotypes can be maintained despite extensive gene flow from divergent populations.},

	abstract = {Graph theory, network theory, and circuit theory are increasingly being used to quantify multiple aspects of habitat connectivity and protected areas. There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of “route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches” and “route redundancy at the level of network components.” We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.},

A multivariate factor analysis was used to identify the common axes (or dimensions) of pattern and structure which were measured by a reduced set of 26 metrics. The first six factors explained about 87\% of the variation in the 26 landscape metrics. These factors were interpreted as composite measures of average patch compaction, overall image texture, average patch shape, patch perimeter-area scaling, number of attribute classes, and large-patch density-area scaling. We suggest that these factors can be represented in a simpler way by six univariate metrics - average perimeter-area ratio, contagion, standardized patch shape, patch perimeter-area scaling, number of attribute classes, and large-patch density-area scaling.},

These ANNs are the most recent development in computer-aided identification and are very different from conventional techniques,. Here we use the potential of ANNs to deal with some of the persistent fuzzy and nonlinear problems that confound classical statistical methods for species diversity prediction. We show that riverine fish diversity patterns on a global scale can be successfully predicted by geographical patterns in local river conditions. Nonlinear relationships, fitted by ANN methods, adequately describe the data, with up to 93 per cent of the total variation in species richness being explained by our results. These findings highlight the dominant effect of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity on patterns of global fish diversity. Our results reinforce the species-energy theory and contrast with those from a recent study on North American mammal species, but, more interestingly, they demonstrate the applicability of ANN methods in ecology.},

	abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

	abstract = {So far in this book, we have looked at populations as if all the individuals comprising them were interchangeable. In reality, this is not so. Walk through an unmown meadow and you will see that different plants of the same species have different sizes, colours and proportions; some may be thornier, have larger leaves, more flowers, or thicker stems than others. Some of these differences are simply attributable to environment: malnourished individuals will usually be relatively small, for example. However, many differences, such as human eye colours, cannot be explained by the environment alone, and instead are influenced by variations in the genetic instructions that regulate development. These instructions tell each cell when and how to construct highly specialised proteins. Genetic instructions are encoded by long strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Different sections of a DNA strand are used at different times; each such section is called a gene. Organisms usually have a very large number of genes; for example, the human genome includes around 30,000 genes. Changes in the prevalence of genes are studied by population geneticists. These changes are intimately tied to the ecology of populations at several levels. Evolution, the long-term consequence of changing gene frequencies, generates the diversity of living forms whose interactions are the subject of ecology. Conversely, ecological factors greatly influence evolution. Lastly, the dynamics of genes have much in common at a theoretical level with the ecological dynamics of species.},

The richness of its biodiversity, and the hostility of its natural environment, mean that even today we can form no clear picture of the Amazon rainforest ecology. Yet even fragmentary glimpses reveal that the Amazon forms an extravagance of nature beyond the wildest imaginings of taxonomists. When biologist T. L. Erwin examined a single species of Amazonian tree, he found 163 unique species of beetle living in its canopy alone (Erwin 1982). Comparing sites seventy kilometres apart, Erwin found only a 1\% overlap in the beetle species present (Erwin 1988). Brazil has more species of flowering plants and amphibians than any other country, and ranks in the top four countries on earth for mammals, birds, butterflies and reptiles (Fearnside 1999).},

A forest is more than just trees, and an ant colony is more than just thousands of individual ants. All of these systems are organised. The whole emerges out of interactions between many individual parts. But just how does that organisation occur? This is the challenge that complexity theory seeks to answer.},

For this broad geographical coverage an indicator approach is the most cost-effective methodology. Landscape metrics are used as indicators in the monitoring programme based on the assumed importance of landscape composition and spatial pattern for a number of countryside interests. However, although indicators have been used successfully over a long period of time in various disciplines, their use in landscape monitoring is relatively new and there is little empirical data with which to assess their validity. This paper provides information on the performance of landscape diversity and landscape heterogeneity indices as estimated by specific biodiversity measures. Preliminary results show increasing numbers of breeding bird species and numbers of vascular plant species with increasing landscape diversity and heterogeneity, two indices that capture information on landscape content and structure. Overall, the heterogeneity index provided a better surrogate for species richness than the diversity index.},

	abstract = {The identification of a universal law that can predict the spatiotemporal structure of any entity at any scale has long been pursued. Thermodynamics have targeted this goal, and the concept of entropy has been widely applied for various disciplines and purposes, including landscape ecology. Within this discipline, however, the uses of the entropy concept and its underlying assumptions are various and are seldom described explicitly. In addition, the link between this concept and thermodynamics is unclear. The aim of this paper is to review the various interpretations and applications of entropy in landscape ecology and to sort them into clearly defined categories. First, a retrospective study of the concept genesis from thermodynamics to landscape ecology was conducted. Then, 50 landscape ecology papers that use or discuss entropy were surveyed and classified by keywords, variables and metrics identified as related to entropy. In particular, the thermodynamic component of entropy in landscape ecology and its various interpretations related to landscape structure and dynamics were considered. From the survey results, three major definitions (i.e., spatial heterogeneity, the unpredictability of pattern dynamics and pattern scale dependence) associated with the entropy concept in landscape ecology were identified. The thermodynamic interpretations of these definitions are based on different theories. The thermodynamic interpretation of spatial heterogeneity is not considered relevant. The thermodynamic interpretation related to scale dependence is also questioned by complexity theory. Only unpredictability can be thermodynamically relevant if appropriate measurements are used to test it.},

However, the results of evaluation are as dependent on the test problems as they are on the algorithms that are the subject of comparison. Unfortunately, developing a test suite for evaluating competing search algorithms is difficult without clearly defined evaluation goals. In this paper we discuss some basic principles that can be used to develop test suites and we examine the role of test suites as they have been used to evaluate evolutionary search algorithms. Current test suites include functions that are easily solved by simple search methods such as greedy hill-climbers. Some test functions also have undesirable characteristics that are exaggerated as the dimensionality of the search space is increased. New methods are examined for constructing functions with different degrees of nonlinearity, where the interactions and the cost of evaluation scale with respect to the dimensionality of the search space.},

	abstract = {The small, deer-like Soay sheep represent the most primitive domestic form of the species in Europe. They may be descended from sheep brought to Britain about 5000 BC or, alternatively, they may have been introduced by the Vikings about the 9th century AD. The present feral population of about 1400 sheep on Hirta, the main island of the St Kilda group, is descended from a flock of 107 sheep which was transferred from the neighbouring island of Soay when the islanders deserted St Kilda in 1932. This book is packed with fascinating and detailed information about the Soay sheep - their physiology, conformation, colour and coat type, their social and sexual behaviour, and the interacting factors which control population size and cause it to fluctuate in a remarkable fashion from year to year. In addition, the habitat, particularly the vegetation and soil, is fully described. The heart of the book is found in those sections by Grubb, and Grubb and Jewell, dealing with social and sexual behaviour, reproduction and population dynamics. These are wide-ranging studies and have a general relevance for all zoologists, ethologists and ecologists quite irrespective of whether they may be interested in Soay sheep. However, these chapters, although of great interest, are excessively detailed. Some data are presented in the form of both tables and diagrams, and descriptive information on the behaviour of individual sheep is extremely lengthy, and perhaps inappropriate in this context. A greater degree of condensation and synthesis would have been welcome. Nevertheless, it is only fair to say that the authors' perceptiveness and enthusiasm are such that they never become tedious. The authoritative studies of Grubb on behaviour and of Gwynn on the vegetation (and its function as the sole food supply of the sheep) result from several years of dedicated work during which they stayed on the island. These, and indeed most of the chapters in this book, are of a high standard. One possible criticism concerns the relative lack of statistical analysis of the data. Quantitative differences are sometimes presented without any indication of their statistical significance or of the degree of variation. The book is fairly well produced for its price, although the standard of reproduction of photographs is disappointing. In general, this book must be rated as an impressive and highly successful record of over 10 years of research under extremely difficult conditions. It cannot fail to be of interest to any biologist. All the contributors and, in particular, the editors, are to be congratulated on completing a daunting but worthwhile task. J. Slee},

	abstract = {The biological evolution of complex organisms, in which the functioning of genes is interdependent, has been analysed as “hill-climbing” on NK fitness landscapes through random mutation and natural selection [Kauffman, S.A., 1993. The Origins of Order. Self-organization and Selection in Evolution. Oxford University Press, New York \&amp; Oxford]. In evolutionary economics, NK fitness landscapes have been used to simulate the design of complex technological systems as a trial-and-error process towards local optima. Interdependencies among a system's elements do not only render the optimisation of product design a difficult task, but also put constraints on the vertical disintegration of production. In this context, evolutionary economists introduced the concept of “dynamic transaction costs” [Langlois, R.N., 1992. Transaction-cost economics in real time. Industrial and Corporate Change 1 (1), 99–127; Langlois, R.N., 2001. The vanishing hand: the changing dynamics of industrial capitalism, Paper presented at the workshop Reappraising Production Theory: Concepts, Cases and Models, Max Planck Institute, Jena, November 29–December 1]. A system integrator outsourcing the production of elements to supplier firms not only transfers production, but to a large extent looses competence and control to bring about innovations in these elements. This is problematic when the element that is being outsourced is functionally interdependent with other elements in the system. The main aim of the paper is to theorise about modular product architectures that allow for outsourcing while reducing the constraints on possible innovation. The primary way to achieve modular architectures is to introduce elements that function as standards mediating interdependencies between other elements. It is argued that only a generalised version of the NK-model, which is developed in this paper, is able to represent this specific quality of standards that render architectures modular. It is also explained how the model of modular architectures differs from the model of decomposable architectures developed in a previous study [Frenken, K., Marengo, L., Valente, M., 1999. Interdependencies, near-decomposability and adaptation. In: Brenner, T. (Ed.), Computational Techniques for Modelling Learning in Economics. Kluwer, Boston, pp. 209–244]. A number of implications are derived from the generalised NK-model model that can be taken up in empirical studies on patterns of vertical disintegration in the life-cycle evolution of specific products. An evolutionary framework of vertical integration is needed to supplement the theory of the product life-cycle.},

An empirical investigation comparing these three types of varying goals on dynamic symbolic regression benchmarks reveals an advantage for goals which vary in terms of increasing structural complexity. This provides evidence to support the added difficulty variable length representations incur due to their requirement to search structural and parametric space concurrently, and how directing search through varying structural goals with increasing complexity can speed up search with genetic programming.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary computation plays a principal role in intelligent design automation. Evolutionary approaches have discovered novel and patentable designs. Nonetheless, evolutionary techniques may lead to designs that lack robustness. This critical issue is strongly connected to the concept of evolvability. In nature, highly evolvable species tend to be found in rapidly changing environments. Such species can be considered robust against environmental changes. Consequently, to create robust engineering designs it could be beneficial to use variable, rather than fixed, fitness criteria. In this paper, we study the performance of an evolutionary programming algorithm with periodical switching between goals, which are selected randomly from a set of related goals. It is shown by a dual-objective filter optimization example that altering goals may improve evolvability to a fixed goal by enhancing the dynamics of solution population, and guiding the search to areas where improved solutions are likely to be found. Our reference algorithm with a single goal is able to find solutions with competitive fitness, but these solutions are results of premature convergence, because they are poorly evolvable. By using the same algorithm with switching goals, we can extend the productive search length considerably; both the fitness and robustness of such designs are improved.},

One of the striking features of evolution is the appearance of novel structures in organisms. The origin of the ability to generate novelty is one of the main mysteries in evolutionary theory. The molecular mechanisms that enhance the evolution of novelty were recently integrated by Kirschner and Gerhart in their theory of facilitated variation. This theory suggests that organisms have a design that makes it more likely that random genetic changes will result in organisms with novel shapes that can survive. Here we demonstrate how facilitated variation can arise in computer simulations of evolution. We propose a quantitative approach for studying facilitated variation in computational model systems. We find that the evolution of facilitated variation is enhanced in environments that change from time to time in a systematic way: the varying environments are made of the same set of subgoals, but in different combinations. Under such varying conditions, the simulated organisms store information about past environments in their genome, and develop a special modular design that can readily generate novel modules.},

	abstract = {Simulations of biological evolution, in which computers are used to evolve systems toward a goal, often require many generations to achieve even simple goals. It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change over time such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

	abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

The right selection pressure is critical in ensuring sufficient optimization progress on the one hand and in preserving genetic diversity to be able to escape from local optima on the other hand. Motivated by a universal similarity relation on the individuals, we propose a new selection scheme, which is uniform in the fitness values. It generates selection pressure toward sparsely populated fitness regions, not necessarily toward higher fitness, as is the case for all other selection schemes. We show analytically on a simple example that the new selection scheme can be much more effective than standard selection schemes. We also propose a new deletion scheme which achieves a similar result via deletion and show how such a scheme preserves genetic diversity more effectively than standard approaches. We compare the performance of the new schemes to tournament selection and random deletion on an artificial deceptive problem and a range of NP hard problems: traveling salesman, set covering, and satisfiability},

	abstract = {To reduce the problem of premature convergence we define a new method for measuring an individual's age and propose the Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS). This new measure of age measures how long the genetic material has been evolving in the population: offspring start with an age of 1 plus the age of their oldest parent instead of starting with an age of 0 as with traditional measures of age. ALPS differs from a typical evolutionary algorithm (EA) by segregating individuals into different age-layers by their age and by regularly introducing new, randomly generated individuals in the youngest layer. The introduction of randomly generated individuals at regular intervals results in an EA that is never completely converged and is always exploring new parts of the fitness landscape. By using age to restrict competition and breeding, younger individuals are able to develop without being dominated by older ones. Analysis of the search behavior of ALPS finds that the offspring of individuals that are randomly generated mid-way through a run are able to move the population out of mediocre local-optima to better parts of the fitness landscape. In comparison against a traditional EA, a multi-start EA and two other EAs with diversity maintenance schemes we find that ALPS produces significantly better designs with a higher reliability than the other EAs.},

	abstract = {A major goal for researchers in neuroevolution is to evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can learn during their lifetime. Such networks can adapt to changes in their environment that evolution on its own cannot anticipate. However, a profound problem with evolving adaptive systems is that if the impact of learning on the fitness of the agent is only marginal, then evolution is likely to produce individuals that do not exhibit the desired adaptive behavior. Instead, because it is easier at first to improve fitness without evolving the ability to learn, they are likely to exploit domain-dependent static (i.e. non-adaptive) heuristics. This paper proposes a way to escape the deceptive trap of static policies based on the novelty search algorithm, which opens up a new avenue in the evolution of adaptive systems because it can exploit the behavioral difference between learning and non-learning individuals. The main idea in novelty search is to abandon objective-based fitness and instead simply search only for novel behavior, which avoids deception entirely and has shown prior promising results in other domains. This paper shows that novelty search significantly outperforms fitness-based search in a tunably deceptive T-Maze navigation domain because it fosters the emergence of adaptive behavior.},

This provides a dual selection pressure towards the exploitation of current non-dominated solutions and the exploration of the search space. We also introduce a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, the Genetic Diversity Evolutionary Algorithm (GDEA), strictly designed around GeDEM and then we compare it with other state-of-the-art algorithms on a well-established suite of test problems. Experimental results clearly indicate that the performance of GDEA is top-level.},

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

	abstract = {Two important problems in genetic programming (GP) are its tendency to find unnecessarily large trees (bloat), and the general evolutionary algorithms problem that diversity in the population can be lost prematurely. The prevention of these problems is frequently an implicit goal of basic GP. We explore the potential of techniques from multi-objective optimization to aid GP by adding explicit objectives to avoid bloat and promote diversity. The even 3, 4, and 5-parity problems were solved efficiently compared to basic GP results from the literature. Even though only non-dominated individuals were selected and populations thus remained extremely small, appropriate diversity was maintained. The size of individuals visited during search consistently remained small, and solutions of what we believe to be the minimum size were found for the 3, 4, and 5-parity problems.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accura...},

	abstract = {Many current Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) suffer from a tendency to converge prematurely or stagnate without progress for complex problems. This may be due to the loss of or failure to discover certain valuable genetic material or the loss of the capability to discover new genetic material before convergence has limited the algorithm's ability to search widely. In this paper, the Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC) model, including several variants, is proposed as a generic framework for sustainable evolutionary search by transforming the convergent nature of the current EA framework into a non-convergent search process. That is, the structure of HFC does not allow the convergence of the population to the vicinity of any set of optimal or locally optimal solutions. The sustainable search capability of HFC is achieved by ensuring a continuous supply and the incorporation of genetic material in a hierarchical manner, and by culturing and maintaining, but continually renewing, populations of individuals of intermediate fitness levels. HFC employs an assembly-line structure in which subpopulations are hierarchically organized into different fitness levels, reducing the selection pressure within each subpopulation while maintaining the global selection pressure to help ensure the exploitation of the good genetic material found. Three EAs based on the HFC principle are tested - two on the even-10-parity genetic programming benchmark problem and a real-world analog circuit synthesis problem, and another on the HIFF genetic algorithm (GA) benchmark problem. The significant gain in robustness, scalability and efficiency by HFC, with little additional computing effort, and its tolerance of small population sizes, demonstrates its effectiveness on these problems and shows promise of its potential for improving other existing EAs for difficult problems. A paradigm shift from that of most EAs is proposed: rather than trying to escape from local optima or delay convergence at a local optimum, HFC allows the emergence of new optima continually in a bottom-up manner, maintaining low local selection pressure at all fitness levels, while fostering exploitation of high-fitness individuals through promotion to higher levels.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this paper are to describe a steady-state version of the Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and to compare it against other GAs on real-valued problems. Motivation for this work comes from our previous success in demonstrating that a generational version of ALPS greatly improves search performance on a Genetic Programming problem. In making steady-state ALPS, some modifications were made to the method for calculating age and the method for moving individuals up age layers. To demonstrate that ALPS works well on real-valued problems we compare it against CMA-ES and Differential Evolution (DE) on five challenging, real-valued functions and on one real-world problem. While CMA-ES and DE outperform ALPS on the two unimodal test functions, ALPS is much better on the three multimodal test problems and on the real-world problem. Further examination shows that, unlike the other GAs, ALPS maintains a genotypically diverse population throughout the entire search process. These findings strongly suggest that the ALPS paradigm is better able to avoid premature convergence then the other GAs.},

These data streams pose a challenge for ecologists because traditional approaches to quality assurance and quality control are no longer practical when confronted with the size of these data sets and the demands of real-time processing. Automated methods for rapidly identifying and (ideally) correcting problematic data are essential. However, advances in sensor hardware have outpaced those in software, creating a need for tools to implement automated quality assurance and quality control procedures, produce graphical and statistical summaries for review, and track the provenance of the data. Use of automated tools would enhance data integrity and reliability and would reduce delays in releasing data products. Development of community-wide standards for quality assurance and quality control would instill confidence in sensor data and would improve interoperability across environmental sensor networks.},

Previous work has demonstrated that the optimisation of constants within these models has been able to significantly improve the quality of the resulting model on unseen data. This paper explores two properties of one particular process model: can the model predictions be improved by optimising the constants over different temporal scales; and can seasonal patterns be identified, based on monthly training scales, that allow further understanding of the response of the freshwater system to changing environmental conditions. The results show that there is some improvement on the prediction of unseen data when using constants of the process model optimised for individual months, versus constants trained over a yearly cycle. Additionally, by studying the patterns of the constants over various time scales some underlying seasonal patterns can be observed. These patterns can be further studied by exploring how the various elements of the process model vary with monthly versus yearly training constants. This work demonstrates some possible directions for understanding how the behaviour of freshwater systems at different time scales can be used to understand the properties of these complexes, non-linear systems. The results also suggest that local models of ecological time series data can be used to extract information that may not be obtainable from a single, global model.},

	abstract = {Many evolutionary studies assume that deleterious mutations necessarily impede adaptive evolution. However, a later mutation that is conditionally beneficial may interact with a deleterious predecessor before it is eliminated, thereby providing access to adaptations that might otherwise be inaccessible. It is unknown whether such sign-epistatic recoveries are inconsequential events or an important factor in evolution, owing to the difficulty of monitoring the effects and fates of all mutations during experiments with biological organisms. Here, we used digital organisms to compare the extent of adaptive evolution in populations when deleterious mutations were disallowed with control populations in which such mutations were allowed. Significantly higher fitness levels were achieved over the long term in the control populations because some of the deleterious mutations served as stepping stones across otherwise impassable fitness valleys. As a consequence, initially deleterious mutations facilitated the evolution of complex, beneficial functions. We also examined the effects of disallowing neutral mutations, of varying the mutation rate, and of sexual recombination. Populations evolving without neutral mutations were able to leverage deleterious and compensatory mutation pairs to overcome, at least partially, the absence of neutral mutations. Substantially raising or lowering the mutation rate reduced or eliminated the long-term benefit of deleterious mutations, but introducing recombination did not. Our work demonstrates that deleterious mutations can play an important role in adaptive evolution under at least some conditions.},

This study documents seasonal patterns of growth, 14C-labelled photoassimilate distribution and remobilization in the invasive rhizomatous species Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed). Biomass accumulation above- and below-ground in F. japonica was rapid. By September, rhizome biomass had increased 18-fold from the initial harvest in May (representing 48\% of total plant biomass) and this was maintained over winter. Patterns of 14C allocation from F. japonica shoots labelled at different times of year show that as the season progressed, the rhizomes became an increasingly important sink for current assimilate (the percentage of 14C recovered from rhizomes was 35\% in August and 67\% in September) and the corresponding retention of assimilate by established shoots declined. The percentage of 14C exported to roots was greatest in August. Relatively little photoassimilate was exported to other shoots on the plant, or to flowers. Recycling of photoassimilate was fairly tight in this species and 14C fixed by shoots in early May 1999 or September 1999 was remobilized to the rhizome prior to shoot senescence and death. Some of this 14C was then remobilized to new shoots early the following spring. These characteristics may contribute to the success of F. japonica in colonizing a variety of contrasting habitats, often with serious management implications.},

The sum of many clade expansions and reductions, each of which happens according to its own dynamic, probably approximates more a damped exponential curve when translated into a global-scale species diversification curve. Unfortunately, it is not possible to plot such a meaningful global-scale species diversification curve through time, but curves at higher taxonomic levels have been produced. These curves are subject to the vagaries of the fossil record, but it is unlikely that the sources of error entirely overwhelm the biological signal. Clades radiate when the external and internal conditions are right: a new territory or ecospace becomes available, and the lineage has acquired a number of characters that open up a new diet or mode of life. Modern high levels of diversity in certain speciose clades may depend on such ancient opportunities taken. Dramatic climatic changes through the Quaternary must have driven extinctions and originations, but many species responded simply by moving to more favourable locations. Ecological communities appear to be no more than merely chance associations of species, but there may be real interactions among species. Ironically, high species diversity may lead to more speciation, not, as had been assumed, less: more species create more opportunities and selective pressures for other species to respond to, rather than capping diversity at a fixed equilibrium level. Studies from the scale of modern ecosystems to global long-term patterns in the fossil record support a model for the exponential diversification of life, and one explanation for a pattern of exponential diversification is that as diversity increases, new forms become ever more refinements of existing forms. In a sense the world becomes increasingly divided into finer niche space. Organisms have a propensity to speciate freely, species richness within ecosystems appears to generate opportunities for more speciation, clades show all kinds of patterns from sluggish speciation rates and constant diversity through time to apparently explosive speciation, and there is no evidence that rapidly speciating clades have reached a limit, nor that they are driving other clades to extinction. A corollary of this view is that current biodiversity must be higher than it has ever been. Limits to infinite growth are clearly local, regional, and global turnover and extinction events, when climate change and physical catastrophes knock out species and whole clades, and push the rising exponential curve down a notch or two.},

Exploiters may drive sympatric (within-population) diversification if there are a variety of exploiter-resistance strategies or fitness costs associated with exploiter resistance. Exploiters may also drive allopatric (between-population) diversification by creating different selection pressures and increasing the rate of random divergence. We examined the effect of a virulent viral parasite (phage) on the diversification of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in spatially structured microcosms. Here we show that in the absence of phages, bacteria rapidly diversified into spatial niche specialists with similar patterns of diversity across replicate populations. In the presence of phages, sympatric diversity was greatly reduced, as a result of phage-imposed reductions in host density decreasing competition for resources. In contrast, allopatric diversity was greatly increased as a result of phage-imposed selection for resistance, which caused populations to follow divergent evolutionary trajectories. These results show that exploiters can drive diversification between populations, but may inhibit diversification within populations by opposing diversifying selection that arises from resource competition.},

Island biogeographic theory has identified the roles of immigration and extinction in relation to area size and proximity to source areas, and the role of speciation is also recognized as an important factor. However, one as yet unexplored possibility is that species diversity itself might help to promote speciation, and indeed the central tenets of island biogeographic theory support such a prediction. Here we use data for plants and arthropods of the volcanic archipelagos of the Canary and Hawaiian Islands to address whether there is a positive relationship between species diversity and rate of diversification. Our index of diversification for each island is the proportion of species that are endemic, and we test our prediction that this increases with increasing species number. We show that even after controlling for several important physical features of islands, diversification is strongly related to species number.},

The breadth of adaptive radiation in an invading lineage is likely to be influenced by the availability of ecological niches, which will be determined to some extent by the diversity of the resident community. High resident diversity may result in existing ecological niches being filled, inhibiting subsequent adaptive radiation. Conversely, high resident diversity could result in the creation of novel ecological niches or an increase in within niche competition driving niche partitioning, thus promoting subsequent diversification. We tested the role of resident diversity on adaptive radiations in experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens that readily diversify into a range of niche specialists when grown in a heterogeneous environment. We allowed an undiversified strain to invade resident communities that varied in the number of niche specialists. The breadth of adaptive radiation attainable by an invading lineage decreased with increasing niche occupation of the resident community. Our results highlight the importance of niche occupation as a constraint on adaptive radiation.},

We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study.Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures’ that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity may have differential effects on the distribution of native and nonnative plant species richness. We examined the effects of spatial heterogeneity on native and nonnative plant species richness distributions in the central part of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA. Spatial heterogeneity around vegetation plots was characterized using landscape metrics, environmental/topographic variables (slope, aspect, elevation, and distance from stream or river), and soil variables (nitrogen, clay, and sand). The landscape metrics represented five components of landscape heterogeneity and were measured at four spatial extents (within varying radii of 120, 240, 480, and 960 m) using the FRAGSTATS landscape pattern analysis program. Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size (AICc) was used to select the best models from a set of multiple linear regression models developed for native and nonnative plant species richness at four spatial extents and three levels of ecological hierarchy (i.e., landscape, land cover, and community). Both native and nonnative plant species richness were positively correlated with edge density, Simpson's diversity index and interspersion/juxtaposition index, and were negatively correlated with mean patch size. The amount of variation explained at four spatial extents and three hierarchical levels ranged from 30\% to 70\%. At the landscape level, the best models explained 43\% of the variation in native plant species richness and 70\% of the variation in nonnative plant species richness (240-m extent). In general, the amount of variation explained was always higher for nonnative plant species richness, and the inclusion of landscape metrics always significantly improved the models. The best models explained 66\% of the variation in nonnative plant species richness for both the conifer land cover type and lodgepole pine community. The relative influence of the components of spatial heterogeneity differed for native and nonnative plant species richness and varied with the spatial extent of analysis and levels of ecological hierarchy. The study offers an approach to quantify spatial heterogeneity to improve models of plant biodiversity. The results demonstrate that ecologists must recognize the importance of spatial heterogeneity in managing native and nonnative plant species.},

	abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is an essential quality of ecosystems as it has important implications in community structure. Macrophytes are a main component of environmental heterogeneity in floodplain lakes, and their dynamics are highly influenced by water level changes. In this context, we analysed at different spatial scales the relationship among hydrological variations, environmental heterogeneity associated to macrophytes and zooplankton regional diversity (γ diversity) in a South American floodplain lake adjacent to the Paraná River, and we also compared the local zooplankton diversity (α diversity) among the different environments that comprised the lake heterogeneity. At very low waters, the environmental heterogeneity was reduced as the lake was mainly limited to open water areas with low zooplankton diversity. At high waters, the profuse vegetation development (emergent and free-floating), in mixed or homogeneous patches, determined a higher lake environmental heterogeneity with enhanced regional zooplankton diversity; littoral species increased over limnetic ones. Zooplankton α diversity was higher in environments with free-floating macrophytes than in those without these plants. The structural complexity in the water column provided by plant roots would be closely related to the enhanced diversity found under free-floating mats. This study contributes to the knowledge on the effects of strong water level variations on environmental heterogeneity, which is strongly associated to macrophytes and on zooplankton diversity, and highlights the role of free-floating plants as diversity hosts and ‘key structures’ in floodplain lakes.

	abstract = {Although all natural systems are heterogeneous, the direct influence of spatial heterogeneity on most ecological variables is unknown. In many systems, spatial heterogeneity is positively correlated with both microhabitat refugia and species richness. Both an increased number of microhabitat refugia and the effects of statistical averaging via increased species richness should lead to an inverse relationship between spatial heterogeneity and variability in community composition. To test this prediction, I measured diversity and temporal variability of invertebrate communities in a northern New Hampshire stream along a natural gradient of spatial heterogeneity formed by variation in stream substrates. On average, there was a 42\% decrease in community variability along a gradient of increasing heterogeneity. This pattern was robust to changes in metrics of both heterogeneity and community variability. There was also a significant positive relationship between taxon richness and spatial heterogeneity with predicted taxon richness increasing c. 1.5× along the heterogeneity gradient. By resampling community abundance data, I estimated that statistical averaging accounted for only 4\% of the observed decrease in community variability in this study. I concluded that the remaining decrease was very likely explained by a greater number of refugia from predation and/or flooding in high-heterogeneity habitats. The results of this study suggest that maximizing heterogeneity in ecological restoration programmes may promote temporally stable and diverse communities and may aid in responsible management of aquatic resources.},

While it is being widely accepted that complete cessation of gene-flow between populations owing to long-lasting geographical barriers results in a steady, irreversible increase of divergence and eventually speciation, the extent to which various degrees of habitat heterogeneity influences speciation rates is less well understood. Here, we investigate how small, randomly distributed physical obstacles influence the distribution of populations and species, the level of population connectivity (e.g. gene flow), as well as the mode and tempo of speciation in a virtual ecosystem composed of prey and predator species. We adapted an existing individual-based platform, EcoSim, to allow fine tuning of the gene flow's level between populations by adding various numbers of obstacles in the world. The platform implements a simple food chain consisting of primary producers, herbivores (prey) and predators. It allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioural models, as well as complex predator–prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We observed a direct and continuous increase in the speed of evolution (e.g. the rate of speciation) with the increasing number of obstacles in the world. The spatial distribution of species was also more compact in the world with obstacles than in the world without obstacles. Our results suggest that environmental heterogeneity and other factors affecting demographic stochasticity can directly influence speciation and extinction rates.},

From its modest beginnings of seven sites, the UC NRS has grown to encompass more than 750,000 wildland acres. This book tells the story of how a few forward-thinking UC faculty, who’d had their research plots and teaching spots destroyed by development and habitat degradation, devised a way to save representative examples of many of California’s major ecosystems. Working together with conservation-minded donors and landowners, with state and federal agencies, and with land trusts and private conservation organizations, they founded what would become the world’s largest university-administered natural reserve system—a legacy of lasting significance and utility. This lavishly illustrated volume, which includes images by famed photographers Ansel Adams and Galen Rowell, describes the natural and human histories of the system’s many reserves. Located throughout California, these wildland habitats range from coastal tide pools to inland deserts, from lush wetlands to ancient forests, and from vernal pools to oak savannas. By supporting teaching, research, and public service within such protected landscapes, the UC NRS contributes to the understanding and wise stewardship of the Earth.},

Modelling species’ niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species’ ranges. * 2A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species’ environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates. * 3We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests. * 4Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species’ potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration.},

The validity of the new genus is established by a discussion of the reasons for the invalidity of the previous assignments. Heddleichthys is characterized by a combination of derived and primitive tristichopterid features. Derived features include the presence of symphyseal dentary fangs and premaxillary pseudofangs, a diamond-shaped symmetric caudal fin, a low posterodorsal expansion of the maxilla, and a posteriorly positioned kite-shaped pineal series. Primitive features include a postorbital and jugal contribution to the orbital margin and a parasphenoid with a ventral keel. External dermal bones are rather poorly preserved in the referred material, with few easily discernible sutures. The holotype specimen, a three-dimensionally preserved skull, was scanned by computed tomography to reveal well-preserved internal dermal bones, including entopterygoids, vomers and parasphenoid. There is no preserved endoskeletal material. As the first representative of derived tristichopterids described from Britain, Heddleichthys lends support to the idea that faunal dispersion between Gondwana and Laurussia in the Late Devonian was widespread. Derived tristichopterids have been described from all continents except South America. In contrast, the basal tristichopterids Eusthenopteron and Tristichopterus are still only described from Laurussia.},

This large fish was previously assigned to Tristichopteridae gen. et sp. indet. due to the lack of diagnostic anatomical data. New available material consists of the internal surface of the parietal shield, vomers and anterior part of the parasphenoid, subopercular and submandibulo-branchiostegal bones, and an internal view of the anterior part of the mandible. A possible autapomorphy of the new form from Belgium, Langlieria socqueti gen. nov. et sp. nov., is the absence of marginal teeth on the vomer except on its most lateral part. Apart from these features, it only differs from the genus Mandageria from Australia in the absence of marginal teeth between the dentary fang and the mandibular symphysis, in the presence of a raised marginal crest lateral to the anterior coronoid fang, and in the presence of numerous small marginal teeth on the premaxilla. It differs from the cosmopolitan genus Eusthenodon in a number of respects: the supratemporal, tabular, and postparietal bones are superficially fused, as are the intertemporal and parietal bones, the dermal ornament is proportionally very fine, and the denticulated field of the parasphenoid stands proud rather than being recessed into the body of the bone.},

	abstract = {Japanese knotweed is an aggressive alien species in Europe, North America, and Australia, causing a range of environmental problems. Eradication of Japanese knotweed is proving to be a difficult task, because the plant is able to propagate generatively by intra- and interspecific hybridization, and vegetatively from shoot and tiny rhizome pieces. Despite the economic consequences of Japanese knotweed on natural and built environments, its physiology is not yet fully understood; especially important are sink-source relations between old and young parts of the rhizome and growth of lateral and latent rhizome buds. Current methods of chemical control include three types of phloem-mobile herbicides, such as glyphosate, imazapyr, and synthetic auxins. These herbicides have limitations on their use, and all fail to eradicate the plant completely, for the reasons discussed in this review. Our aim is to suggest prospective approaches to enable chemical eradication: use of signals to induce controlled growth and development of quiescent rhizome buds; use of phytohormones, sugars, and light to increase allocation of phloem-mobile herbicides to the rhizome; use of xylem-mobile herbicides to exterminate the old rhizome parts; and use of different phloem-mobile herbicides at different growth stages.},

Only 29\% of the explants showed tuber formation after 3 weeks in the presence of 1\% sucrose in contrast to 100\% with 3\%. After 120 days of culture, the length and the weight of the tubers obtained in the presence of 1\% sucrose were less than with 3\% sucrose. Addition of sorbitol to keep osmolarity at the same level did not restore normal rate of tuber formation. Similar results were obtained with the use of reduced fructose or glucose level. Microtuber sprouting was also affected by sucrose level incorporated into the tuberisation medium. Tubers obtained on reduced sucrose level sprouted later and the increase of osmolarity with sorbitol did not restore normal sprouting. The bigger tubers obtained on high sucrose media could contain more carbohydrate reserves that could partially explain a higher sprouting rate. These results can be used for optimising in vitro conditions for mass production of microtubers in yam and especially in Dioscorea cayenensis–D. rotundata complex, a very important species in West Africa. They specially showed the importance of tuberisation conditions on precocity of tuberisation, on tuber length and weight and on their further sprouting.},

	abstract = {In onion (Allium cepa L.) postponement of sprouting is necessary to achieve long term storage. We studied the factors determining sprouting during dry storage at 16°C. The period to visible sprouting depends on the length of the dormancy period, if present, and on the growth rate of the sprout. In the three cultivars tested, sprouts were initiated within 2 weeks after harvest indicating the absence of a real dormancy period. Sprout length increased linearly during storage. The mitotic activity of the apex decreased before harvest, was low at the transition from scale to leaf formation, and increased again when the sprout was initiated. From a few weeks before harvest, the initially high fructan content of the scales decreased, leading to a large increase in fructose. The sprout always contained enough carbohydrates for growth (between 50 and 60 mg g−1 dry weight, of which 30\% was fructan). The activity of sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13) increased as the sprout grew, indicating an increase in sink strength. Invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) was absent in all bulb organs, during the various developmental stages. Although carbohydrates and enzymes were available for fast sprouting, sprout growth was still linear instead of exponential during dry storage at temperatures favorable for growth (16°C). The relative importance of factors determining sprouting are discussed.},

To date, no eradication method is available for land managers facing the invasion of this rhizomatous plant.

The tested control methods were selected to be potentially usable by managers, e.g., using legally accepted rates for herbicides. Stem volume, height and density reduction were assessed after one or two years, depending on the control method. Labor estimations were made for each control method. No tested control method completely eradicated the clones. Stem injection with glyphosate-based herbicide (3.6 kg ha−1 of acid equivalent glyphosate) caused the most damage, i.e., no sprouting shoots were observed the year following the injection. The following year, though, stunted shoots appeared. Among the mechanical control methods, repeated cuts combined with native tree transplanting most appreciably reduced knotweed development. The most efficient methods we tested could curb knotweed invasion, but are not likely to be effective in eradicating the species.

Greenhouse experiments explored the effectiveness of cutting as a control measure. Patterns of biomass allocation to above- and below-ground portions of uncut plants over a growing season were monitored, and cutting experiments were performed to determine the effects on below-ground biomass of cutting, timing of cutting, time interval between cuts, and multiple cuts. The allocation to below-ground biomass was continuous during the growing season, with the total below-ground biomass exceeding the above-ground biomass in the latter half of the growing season. Cut plants had significantly less below-ground biomass accumulation at the end of the growing season compared to uncut controls. Rhizome biomass at the end of the growing season was inversely related to the number of cuts. With 1, 2, and 3 cuts, below-ground biomass was 65, 31 and 13\%, respectively, of uncut controls. Regression analysis predicted that a minimum of 4 cuts are needed during a single growing season to cause a net depletion of below-ground biomass. The timing of cutting does not appear to be critical as long as it is done at least 7 weeks prior to senescence. Given its continuous allocation to rhizomes and its ability to sprout from as little as 7 g of rhizome, it is unlikely that F. japonica can be eradicated by cutting alone.},

	abstract = {Perennial weeds can be a major constraint to organic crop production and direct control actions applied between crops can then be necessary to reduce the problems. We conducted two experiments, one on a sandy loam and one on a sandy soil in Denmark, with the aim of studying the efficacy of different implement types and strategies. The treatments were employed against mixed stands of perennials after harvest of spring barley in two consecutive years. Time of treatment, cultivation depth and combinations of implements constituted the strategies. Treatment effects were evaluated in the growing season that followed the post-harvest treatments. In the one experiment, repeated tine cultivation caused an 80–90\% annual reduction of the population of mainly Cirsium arvense. With treatments conducted in two consecutive years, the accumulated effects reached 99\% control. In the second experiment, power take-off driven implements with rotating weeding devices demonstrated similar control efficacies against a mixed stand composing C. arvense, Tussilago farfara, Elytrigia repens and Artemisia vulgaris. One pass was conducted a week after barley harvest followed by another pass 3 weeks later and ending the strategy with mouldboard ploughing in the succeeding spring. Grain yields did not differ among the treatments in the two experiments as a result of the generally high effectiveness exerted by the control strategies. Especially post-harvest control strategies based on rotating weed devices and mouldboard ploughing appear to be effective solutions against mixed stands of perennials on sandy soils but they do not comply with optimal nutrient management in organic cropping. Therefore, intensive autumn cultivation is only relevant where a perennial weed problem is uncontrollable by other means.},

American pondweed (Potamogeton nodosus Poiret) winter buds, and hydrilla (Hydrib la verticillata (L.f.) Royle, monoecious and dioecious types) tubers were allowed to sprout in water in the dark. At two-to-three day intervals individual propagules and dependent shoots were analyzed for soluble sugars. There was a significant decline in propagule fresh weight over time indicating mobilization of stored materials. Sucrose was the most abundant in all the propagules, but found in higher soluble concentrations in American pondweed winter buds than in hydrilla propagules. Fructose, glucose, raffinose, and sucrose were present in American pondweed, and hydrilla. Stachyose was present in all except dioecious hydrilla and sorbitol was not detected. During sprouting, soluble sugar concentrations decreased within the original propagule and increased in shoots for hydrilla biotypes. Fructose and glucose concentrations were greater in newly formed shoots than in winter buds of American pondweed by day 14 and in hydrilla shoots versus propagules by day 22. The striking increases in concentrations of these soluble sugars in propagules and newly emergent leaf tissue suggest that starch hydrolysis is a key metabolic control point during sprouting.},

	abstract = {The balance between the capacities of RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) carboxylation (Vcmax) and RuBP regeneration (expressed as the maximum electron transport rate, Jmax) determines the CO2 dependence of the photosynthetic rate. As it has been suggested that this balance changes depending on the growth temperature, the hypothesis that the seasonal change in air temperature affects the balance and modulates the CO2 response of photosynthesis was tested. Vcmax and Jmax were determined in summer and autumn for young and old leaves of Polygonum cuspidatum grown at two CO2 concentrations (370 and 700 μmol mol−1). Elevated CO2 concentration tended to reduce both Vcmax and Jmax without changing the Jmax:Vcmax ratio. The seasonal environment, on the other hand, altered the ratio such that the Jmax:Vcmax ratio was higher in autumn leaves than summer leaves. This alternation made the photosynthetic rate more dependent on CO2 concentration in autumn. Therefore, when photosynthetic rates were compared at growth CO2 concentration, the stimulation in photosynthetic rate was higher in young-autumn than in young-summer leaves. In old-autumn leaves, the stimulation of photosynthesis brought by a change in the Jmax:Vcmax ratio was partly offset by accelerated leaf senescence under elevated CO2. Across the two seasons and the two CO2 concentrations, Vcmax was strongly correlated with Rubisco and Jmax with cytochrome f content. These results suggest that seasonal change in climate affects the relative amounts of photosynthetic proteins, which in turn affect the CO2 response of photosynthesis.},

Historically, each processor has had access to a large private cache that seamlessly and transparently (to end users) interfaced with main memory. Previously, processes or threads only had to compete for memory bandwidth, but now they are competing for actual space. Competition for space and environmental resources is a problem studied in other scientific domains. This paper introduces methods from ecology to model multi-core cache usage with the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations. A model is presented and validated for characterizing the interaction of cores through shared caching, and for predicting the degree to which different workloads will interfere with each others’ execution from cache contention.},

	isbn = {9780520216549},
	abstract = {Helen Hardacre provides new insights into the spiritual and cultural dimensions of abortion debates around the world in this careful examination of mizuko kuyo--a Japanese religious ritual for aborted fetuses. Popularized during the 1970s, when religious entrepreneurs published frightening accounts of fetal wrath and spirit attacks, mizuko kuyo offers ritual atonement for women who, sometimes decades previously, chose to have abortions. As she explores the complex issues that surround this practice, Hardacre takes into account the history of Japanese attitudes toward abortion, the development of abortion rituals, the marketing of religion, and the nature of power relations in intercourse, contraception, and abortion.Although abortion in Japan is accepted and legal and was commonly used as birth control in the early postwar period, entrepreneurs used images from fetal photography to mount a surprisingly successful tabloid campaign to promote mizuko kuyo. Enthusiastically adopted by some religionists as an economic strategy, it was soundly rejected by others on doctrinal, humanistic, and feminist grounds.In four field studies in different parts of the country, Helen Hardacre observed contemporary examples of mizuko kuyo as it is practiced in Buddhism, Shinto, and the new religions. She also analyzed historical texts and contemporary personal accounts of abortion by women and their male partners and conducted interviews with practitioners to explore how a commercialized ritual form like mizuko kuyo can be marketed through popular culture and manipulated by the same forces at work in the selling of any commodity. Her conclusions reflect upon the deep current of misogyny and sexism running through these rites and through feto-centric discourse in general.},

	abstract = {Preface Going out for a long walk, the nineteenth-century novelist and essayist Robert Louis Stevenson would bring with him the classic English walking essay, William Hazlitt's "On Going a Journey" (1821), about which he claimed, passionately if dogmatically, it is "so good that there should be a tax levied on all who have not read it." Imagine being so taken with an essay on walking! But history, at least of a past two hundred years, reveals that walkers have loved to read about their passion; and-given the perennial market for magazine essays and fictions, poems, and novels either describing a walk or set on a walk-that non-walking readers also like to imagine life occurring on the path or pavement. The three editors have in common a love of walking and love of the literature of walking. We are all university scholars who have written books on literature and walking, and through this last connection have come to know one another. The mutually infectious nature of the subject and our dedication to it led to the present volume. To this end we have walked the streets of Manhattan and around the Central Park Reservoir, huddled in a Chicago hotel room, and tramped the bluffs on the Northern California coast, culling from memory our favorite walking pieces from the great collective wellspring of human writing. We have composed our anthology for both pedestrian and non-pedestrian readers. Is there a person alive, except for the physically disabled, who is not a walker? Everyone walks, but we address those wholovewalking, either on the ground or in the imagination. When about 100 years ago he compiledThe Lore of the Wanderer: An Open-Air Anthology, a small plain blue-covered book one could put in a back pocket, George Goodchild-in perhaps the first of a substantial cluster of such collections-caught the spirit of our end-of-this-century volume: a book (a companion) to be taken with you; or, if you cannot get out for a walk, you can read one at home. There are, however, important differences between Goodchild's collection and ours. By "Open-Air" he meant the air of the country-side far from the polluting enclosures of the city. By insisting upon walking as a rural pleasure, Goodchild bl},

Japan has undergone much less improvement in women's economic status than Taiwan, despite its more advanced economy and greater welfare provisions. The difference is particularly puzzling because the two countries share many institutional practices and values.Drawing on historical trends, survey statistics, and personal interviews with people in both countries, Yu shows how country-specific organizational arrangements and industrial policies affect women's employment. In particular, the conditions faced by Japanese and Taiwanese women in the workplace have a profound effect on their labor force participation at critical points in their lives. Women's lifetime employment decisions in turn shape the divergent trajectories in gender equality.Few studies documenting the development of women's economic lives are based on non-Western societies and even fewer adopt a comparative perspective. This perceptive work demonstrates and underscores the importance of understanding gender inequality as a long-term, dynamic social process.},

	abstract = {Why has postwar Japanese abortion policy been relatively progressive, while contraception policy has been relatively conservative? The Japanese government legalized abortion in 1948 but did not approve the pill until 1999. In this carefully researched study, Tiana Norgren argues that these contradictory policies flowed from very different historical circumstances and interest group configurations. Doctors and family planners used a small window of opportunity during the Occupation to legalize abortion, and afterwards, doctors and women battled religious groups to uphold the law. The pill, on the other hand, first appeared at an inauspicious moment in history. Until circumstances began to change in the mid-1980s, the pharmaceutical industry was the pill's lone champion: doctors, midwives, family planners, and women all opposed the pill as a potential threat to their livelihoods, abortion rights, and women's health.Clearly written and interwoven with often surprising facts about Japanese history and politics, Norgren's book fills vital gaps in the cross-national literature on the politics of reproduction, a subject that has received more attention in the European and American contexts. Abortion Before Birth Control will be a valuable resource for those interested in abortion and contraception policies, gender studies, modern Japanese history, political science, and public policy. This is a major contribution to the literature on reproductive rights and the role of civil society in a country usually discussed in the context of its industrial might.},

	abstract = {This book addresses how gender became a defining category in the political and social modernization of Japan. During the early decades of the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Japanese encountered an idea with great currency in the West: that the social position of women reflected a country’s level of civilization. Although elites initiated dialogue out of concern for their country’s reputation internationally, the conversation soon moved to a new public sphere where individuals engaged in a wide-ranging debate about women’s roles and rights. By examining these debates throughout the 1870s and 1880s, Marnie S. Anderson argues that shifts in the gender system led to contradictory consequences for women. On the one hand, as gender displaced status as the primary system of social and legal classification, women gained access to the language of rights and the chance to represent themselves in public and play a limited political role; on the other, the modern Japanese state permitted women’s political participation only as an expression of their “citizenship through the household” and codified their formal exclusion from the political process through a series of laws enacted in 1890. This book shows how “a woman’s place” in late-nineteenth-century Japan was characterized by contradictions and unexpected consequences, by new opportunities and new constraints.},

Hokkeji rejects the commonly accepted notion that women simply internalized orthodox Buddhist discourses meant to discourage female practice and offers new perspectives on the religious lives of women in premodern Japan. Its attention to the relationship between doctrine and socio-cultural practice produces a fuller view of Buddhism as it was practiced on the ground, outside the rarefied world of Buddhist scholasticism.},

	abstract = {Japan's postwar transformation has been hailed as nothing short of a miracle. Yet, in the midst of massive social, economic, political, and cultural change, gender inequality persists at remarkably high levels. The paradox of Japan's progress against the persistence of gender inequality raises the question of why women remain a half-step behind men, more than a half century after women were granted equal rights under the postwar constitution. This question has been studied from a variety of perspectives. Anthropologists observe gender roles in Japanese culture, while economists study labor market conditions in Japan. This book offers a political perspective, and analyzes gender inequality in terms of power - specifically the power, or lack of power, that women themselves may exercise to create social change. Through the examination of women's groups, women's centers, and women's policy, this book documents state intervention in the women's movement in Japan. This intervention takes the form of regulations that limit the independence of women's organizations, as well as resources that aid and influence their activities. The result is a relationship between women and the state that is more cooperative than conflictual, leading to a slow and incremental process of social change for women in Japan.},

	abstract = {Inclusive fitness theory predicts that natural selection will favour altruist genes that are more accurate in targeting altruism only to copies of themselves. In this paper, we provide evidence from digital evolution in support of this prediction by competing multiple altruist-targeting mechanisms that vary in their accuracy in determining whether a potential target for altruism carries a copy of the altruist gene. We compete altruism-targeting mechanisms based on (i) kinship (kin targeting), (ii) genetic similarity at a level greater than that expected of kin (similarity targeting), and (iii) perfect knowledge of the presence of an altruist gene (green beard targeting). Natural selection always favoured the most accurate targeting mechanism available. Our investigations also revealed that evolution did not increase the altruism level when all green beard altruists used the same phenotypic marker. The green beard altruism levels stably increased only when mutations that changed the altruism level also changed the marker (e.g. beard colour), such that beard colour reliably indicated the altruism level. For kin- and similarity-targeting mechanisms, we found that evolution was able to stably adjust altruism levels. Our results confirm that natural selection favours altruist genes that are increasingly accurate in targeting altruism to only their copies. Our work also emphasizes that the concept of targeting accuracy must include both the presence of an altruist gene and the level of altruism it produces.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for incremental concept formation based on a Bayesian framework. The algorithm, called IGMM (for Incremental Gaussian Mixture Model), uses a probabilistic approach for modeling the environment, and so, it can rely on solid arguments to handle this issue. IGMM creates and continually adjusts a probabilistic model consistent to all sequentially presented data without storing or revisiting previous training data. IGMM is particularly useful for incremental clustering of data streams, as encountered in the domain of moving object trajectories and mobile robotics. It creates an incremental knowledge model of the domain consisting of primitive concepts involving all observed variables. Experiments with simulated data streams of sonar readings of a mobile robot shows that IGMM can efficiently segment trajectories detecting higher order concepts like “wall at right” and “curve at left”.},

	abstract = {Tauopathies are characterized by abnormal aggregation of the microtubule associated protein tau. This aggregation is thought to occur when tau undergoes shifts from its native conformation to one that exposes hydrophobic areas on separate monomers, allowing contact and subsequent association into oligomers and filaments. Molecular chaperones normally function by binding to exposed hydrophobic stretches on proteins and assisting in their refolding. Chaperones of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family have been implicated in the prevention of abnormal tau aggregation in adult neurons. Tau exists as six alternatively spliced isoforms, and all six isoforms appear capable of forming the pathological aggregates seen in Alzheimer's disease. Because tau isoforms differ in primary sequence, we sought to determine whether Hsp70 would differentially affect the aggregation and microtubule assembly characteristics of the various tau isoforms. We found that Hsp70 inhibits tau aggregation directly and not through inducer-mediated effects. We also determined that Hsp70 inhibits the aggregation of each individual tau isoform and was more effective at inhibiting the three repeat isoforms. Finally, all tau isoforms robustly induced microtubule formation while in the presence of Hsp70. The results presented herein indicate that Hsp70 affects tau isoform dysfunction while having very little impact on the normal function of tau to mediate microtubule assembly. This indicates that targeting Hsp70 to tau may provide a therapeutic approach for the treatment of tauopathies that avoids disruption of normal tau function.},

However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate4, 5, 6, recent work on functional trait spectra7, 8, 9, and metabolic scaling theory10, 11, here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships7, 8 and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.},

We suggest that their success is partially explained by biological and chemical niche construction. In this paper, we explored the microbial mechanisms by which the plant modifies the nitrogen cycle. We found that Fallopia spp. decreased potential denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) by reducing soil moisture and reducing denitrifying bacteria density in the soil. The plant also reduced potential ammonia and nitrite oxydizing bacteria enzyme activities (respectively, AOEA and NOEA) in sites with high AOEA and NOEA in uninvaded situation. Modification of AOEA and NOEA were not correlated to modifications of the density of implicated bacteria. AOB and Nitrobacter-like NOB community genetic structures were significantly different in respectively two and three of the four tested sites while the genetic structure of denitrifying bacteria was not affected by invasion in none of the tested sites. Modification of nitrification and denitrification functioning in invaded soils could lead to reduced nitrogen loss from the ecosystem through nitrate leaching or volatilization of nitrous oxides and dinitrogen and could be considered as a niche construction mechanism of Fallopia.},

	abstract = {Sexual reproduction is known to be an important means of propagation for native Japanese knotweed populations in Asia. For naturalized populations in the United States, however, its relative importance compared with propagation by rhizome and stem fragments has not been established. This article presents two related studies that address two basic questions regarding the potential for propagation by seed: (1) are seeds that are produced by Japanese knotweed in areas of Philadelphia, PA, capable of germinating in the field? If so, (2) when and how rapidly during the year do these seeds acquire germinability? Field germination experiments assessed germination of planted seeds at intervals during the growing season at two different study sites (one in 2000 and the other in 2002) and showed that germination was common at both sites. The 2002 experiment also demonstrated that germination occurred both within existing stands of Japanese knotweed and in areas well removed from existing stands, and that both planted and naturally occurring seeds germinated. Experiments on seasonal acquisition of seed germinability used batches of seeds collected weekly between early September and November 2000 from three different study sites. Results showed that at two of the study sites, a rapid increase in germinability from less than 10\% to greater than 90\% occurred between collection dates in mid-September and mid-October 2000. A smaller and more gradual change occurred at the third site, where maximum germinability was roughly 50\%. Regarding management of Japanese knotweed, the field germination experiments suggest that spread of this plant by seed is a realistic possibility in the United States. Because of the rapidity with which germinability is acquired, the high germinability attained, and the large number of seeds produced, we recommend that female (male-sterile) plants or their inflorescences be removed from seed-producing populations before the formation of fruits to minimize spread by seed.},

	abstract = {Physiological traits that contribute to the establishment and spread of invasive plant species could also have impacts on ecosystem processes. The traits prevalent in many invasive plants, such as high specific leaf areas, rapid growth rates, and elevated leaf nutrient concentrations, improve litter quality and should increase rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling. To test for these ecosystem impacts, we measured initial leaf litter properties, decomposition rates, and nutrient dynamics in 11 understory plants from the Hawaiian islands in control and nitrogen + phosphorus fertilized plots. These included five common native species, four of which were ferns, and six aggressive invasive species, including five angiosperms and one fern. We found a 50-fold variation in leaf litter decay rates, with natives decaying at rates of 0.2–2.3 year −1 and invaders at 1.4–9.3 year −1. This difference was driven by very low decomposition rates in native fern litter. Fertilization significantly increased the decay rates of leaf litter from two native and two invasive species. Most invasive litter types lost nitrogen and phosphorus more rapidly and in larger quantities than comparable native litter types. All litter types except three native ferns lost nitrogen after 100 days of decomposition, and all litter types except the most recalcitrant native ferns lost \&gt;50\% of initial phosphorus by the end of the experiment (204–735 days). If invasive understory plants displace native species, nutrient cycling rates could increase dramatically due to rapid decomposition and nutrient release from invasive litter. Such changes are likely to cause a positive feedback to invasion in Hawai’i because many invasive plants thrive on nutrient-rich soils.},

	title = {Invasive knotweed affects native plants through allelopathy},
	volume = {98},
	url = {http://www.amjbot.org/content/98/1/38.abstract},
	abstract = {• Premise of study: There is increasing evidence that many plant invaders interfere with native plants through allelopathy. This allelopathic interference may be a key mechanism of plant invasiveness. One of the most aggressive current plant invaders is the clonal knotweed hybrid Fallopia × bohemica, which often forms monocultures in its introduced range. Preliminary results from laboratory studies suggest that allelopathy could play a role in this invasion.• Methods: We grew experimental communities of European plants together with F. × bohemica. We used activated carbon to test for allelopathic effects, and we combined this with single or repeated removal of Fallopia shoots to examine how mechanical control can reduce the species’ impact.• Key results: Addition of activated carbon to the soil significantly reduced the suppressive effect of undamaged F. × bohemica on native forbs. The magnitude of this effect was similar to that of regular cutting of Fallopia shoots. Regular cutting of Fallopia shoots efficiently inhibited the growth of rhizomes, together with their apparent allelopathic effects.• Conclusions: The ecological impact of F. × bohemica on native forbs is not just a result of competition for shared resources, but it also appears to have a large allelopathic component. Still, regular mechnical control successfully eliminated allelopathic effects. Therefore, allelopathy will create an additional challenge to knotweed management and ecological restoration only if the allelochemicals are found to persist in the soil. More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying Fallopia allelopathy, and the long-term effects of soil residues.},

	url = {http://www.amjbot.org/content/94/5/776.abstract},
	abstract = {Restoring native diversity to habitats dominated by invasive plants requires improved understanding of mechanisms that allow introduced plants to retain dominance. We used a factorial transplant experiment to assess whether light limitation, nutrient limitation, or allelopathic interference by Fallopia xbohemica reduces growth or survival of Eupatorium perfoliatum or Acer saccharinum. Increased light improved A. saccharinum performance but had no effect on E. perfoliatum growth. Increased light had no effect on A. saccharinum survival but improved E. perfoliatum survival. Activated carbon addition had short-term benefits allowing E. perfoliatum plants to grow for 4 wk and increased A. saccharinum leaf width but not biomass. Nutrient addition had no beneficial effect on transplants. These results in combination with the outcome of a cutting experiment suggest that F. xbohemica achieves competitive superiority primarily by limiting access to light. Species-specific effects and significant interaction effects particularly of light and activated carbon suggest additional mechanisms. Allelopathic interference or interaction with microbial soil organisms may contribute to the lack of native species in populations of F. xbohemica. Restoration efforts should combine selective F. xbohemica control with soil amendments (such as activated carbon) to assess their potential to facilitate return of native species to invaded habitats.},

	abstract = {Polygonum cuspidatum was grown hydroponically to examine the effect of nitrogen removal from the nutrient solution upon plant growth and the partitioning of dry matter and nitrogen among organs. Nitrogen removal reduced the growth rate mainly due to the reduced growth of leaf area. Accelerated root growth was observed only in plants which earlier had received high levels of nitrogen. Nitrogen removal caused almost exclusive allocation of available nitrogen to root growth. Nitrogen flux from the shoot to the root occurred in plants which had received low nitrogen. Not only was net assimilation rate (NAR) little affected by nitrogen removal, but it also was not correlated with the concentration of leaf nitrogen on an area basis. Light-saturated CO. exchange rate (CER) was highly correlated with the concentration of leaf nitrogen. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in CER (CER divided by leaf nitrogen) remained constant against leaf nitrogen, indicating efficient use of nitrogen under light saturation, while NUE in terms of NAR decreased with higher concentration of leaf nitrogen.},

We use this approach to de ne two statistics: cumulative evolutionary activity and mean cumulative evolutionary activity. Then we measure the dynamics of cumulative evolutionary activity, mean cumulative evolutionary activity and diversity, on an evolutionary time scale, in two arti cial systems and in the biosphere as reected in the fossil record. We also measure these statistics in selectively-neutral analogues of the arti cial models. Comparing these data prompts us to draw three conclusions: (i) evolutionary activity statistics do measure continual adaptive success, (ii) evolutionary activity statistics can be compared in arti cial systems and in the biosphere, and (iii) there is an arrow of increasing cumulative evolutionary activity in the biosphere but not in the arti cial models of evolution. The third conclusion is quantitative evidence that the arti cial evolving systems are qualitatively di erent from the biosphere.},

The underwhelming success of the models suggests that there must be more to open-ended evolution than just unbounded evolutionary activity as the term is currently defined.
